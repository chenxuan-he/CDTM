1. The sequential lasso approach employs a sparse high-dimensional linear model, progressively selecting features through a series of penalized least squares calculations. Each prior selection is taken into account in the subsequent step, utilizing a penalized slasso method that extends the BIC and EBIC criteria for stopping. This process aims to identify features that converge with high probability in the relevant feature space, filtering out irrelevant options. The EBIC score's decrease indicates when to stop, ensuring the selection reaches an asymptotically optimal property. With consistent feature selection consistency, the slasso method eventually consists exclusively of relevant features, demonstrating its oracle-like property. However, the slasso approach may diverge for certain relevant features, necessitating a balance between selecting features effectively in high dimensions.

Furthermore, they investigate the consistency and oracle properties of the LASSO method, demonstrating its ability to select relevant features while avoiding irrelevant ones. The study also highlights the advantages of the LASSO method in terms of handling high-dimensional data and achieving convergence.

4. The article explores the application of the LASSO method for feature selection in the presence of ultra-high dimensional data. The authors propose an extension of the BIC and EBIC stopping rules to enhance the selection process. They analyze the convergence properties of the LASSO method, emphasizing its ability to select relevant features and avoid selecting irrelevant ones. The study demonstrates the consistency of the LASSO selection process, its oracle property, and its computational efficiency in handling large-scale data sets.
