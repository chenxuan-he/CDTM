1. This study examines the consistency of maximum likelihood estimation in the context of undirected random graphs with vertices and the approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix. The analysis reveals the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator and the mild theoretical conditions required for genetic genomic analysis. In particular, we focus on the sparse high-dimensional multivariate regression framework, where we investigate the conditional independence relationships between genes while adjusting for genetic effects. By specifying an adjusted Gaussian graph, we account for the confounding genetic effects and the gene expression data. The conditional dependence structure is accurately captured using an adjusted precision matrix, which is obtained through a constrained minimization process that can be easily implemented using linear programming. The results demonstrate asymptotic convergence rates for the matrix norm, sign consistency of the regression coefficients, and a significant improvement in the precision matrix graphical structure. This advancement allows for the identification of gene-genetic variant interactions in the MAPK signaling pathway in yeast genetics.

2. We propose a dynamic treatment regime that incorporates a sequential decision rule based on a patient's history and learning from the main treatment regime. This approach yields beneficial outcomes in clinical trials and observational learning settings. The learning process involves partitioning the outcome regression into components representing the treatment contrast and treatment assignment. By maximizing the doubly robust augmented inverse probability weighted outcome, we ensure robustness to misspecification in the regression model. This is particularly important in the context of linearity, where joint constant variance assumptions are routinely made but can lead to blindly applied dimension reduction techniques, resulting in efficiency loss. However, we surprisingly discover that holding the central subspace assumptions may bring efficiency loss without providing the expected benefits. Instead, we advocate for the exploration of sliced inverse regression and the principal Hessian direction to explain the empirical discovery and its theoretical investigation.

3. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is frequently used to evaluate the classification accuracy of diagnostic tests. We reformulate the ROC curve by incorporating the idea of composite quantile regression, which preserves the conventional location-scale idea. This approach allows for the assessment of the ROC curve's false positive rate, offering a favorable comparison to the main competitor error metrics. The results extend the classical ROC curve analysis, providing asymptotic normality for the regression outcomes and receiver operating characteristic curve. This improvement favourably competes with existing methods and is of particular interest for national Alzheimer's disease coordinating centers.

Specifically, we investigate the conditional independence relationships between genes while adjusting for genetic effects and the impact of gene expression data. By utilizing an adjusted precision matrix, we accurately capture the conditional dependence structure and obtain it through a constrained minimization process that is linear programming-friendly. The results showcase asymptotic convergence rates for the matrix norm, sign consistency of regression coefficients, and a substantial enhancement in the precision matrix graphical structure.
