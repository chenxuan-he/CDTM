The residuals in this context behave asymptotically as independent random variables, with involvement depending on the application and detection of changes in unobservable innovations. This leads to an asymptotically free constrained multivariate distribution, where the location and scatter are determined by finding the global minimum of an objective function subject to constraints.

1. The study examines the behavior of residual series in the context of the squared residual ARCH process, which is distinct from the standard ARMA process. The residuals exhibit properties of asymptotically independent random variables, becoming asymptotically free from the influence of unobservable innovations. The application of this framework is particularly relevant for change detection in scenarios where such innovations occur.

2. In the realm of empirical processes, the asymptotic properties of the sequential empirical process are investigated, focusing on the squared residual arch sequence. This differs from the typical residual ARMA process, as the former exhibits a unique behavior pattern. The residuals approach independence asymptotically,free from the constraints of detectable changes in the underlying process. The study has implications for applications involving the detection of unobservable changes.

3. The analysis centers on the behavior of residuals within the asymptotic framework, specifically within the squared residual ARCH process, which contrasts with the common ARMA process. The residuals are shown to behave asymptotically as independent random variables, which is particularly valuable in scenarios where detecting changes in the process is of interest.

4. The focus is on the squared residual ARCH process, a novelty in the realm of residual analysis that departs from the traditional ARMA process. The residuals in this process exhibit a behavior akin to that of asymptotically independent random variables, providing a valuable tool for detecting unobservable changes in the underlying process.

5. This research delves into the properties of the squared residual ARCH process, offering a departure from the standard ARMA process. The residuals are characterized by their asymptotic independence, which is advantageous for applications that involve identifying changes in the process that are not directly observable.

1. The study introduces a novel approach for analyzing the behavior of squared residual sequences in the context of asymptotic independence. The proposed method involves comparing the residuals of an ARCH process to those of an ARMA process, highlighting the differences in their asymptotic properties. This comparison is particularly useful for applications in change point detection, where unobservable innovations play a crucial role.

2. The analysis focuses on the asymptotic behavior of the constrained multivariate location-scatter objective function, which is found to have a global minimum under certain conditions. The study explores the implications of imposing constraints on the objective function and compares the results with those obtained from a regular objective function. Unfortunately, the constrained objective function may exhibit local minima, complicating the task at hand.

3. The research presents a method for determining the optimal parameters of a constrained multivariate location-scatter stationary process, subject to certain constraints. The proposed approach involves redefining the objective function to incorporate the desired constraints, resulting in a redescending objective function that promotes sparsity. The study compares the performance of this method with that of a regular objective function in terms of achieving a global minimum.

4. The paper introduces a novel detection method for change points in time series data, based on the behavior of asymptotically independent random sequences. The method relies on the concept of an asymptotically free constrained multivariate location-scatter process, which is shown to have certain advantages over traditional methods. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach through simulations and real-world data examples.

5. The research investigates the properties of a dual-level (DL) functional objective function for multiple stationary objectives, which has been observed to behave differently from a regular objective function. The study highlights the challenges associated with finding a global minimum for this type of objective function, and proposes a new method for carrying out this task. The proposed method calls for a regularization technique that helps to overcome the issue of local minima and improves the overall performance of the algorithm.
