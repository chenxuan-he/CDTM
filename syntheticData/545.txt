1. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of volatility decomposition, highlighting the multiplicative nature of volatility. We decompose volatility into stationary and nonstationary components, providing a robust test to determine the prevalent part. The stationary part exhibits conditional heteroskedasticity, while the nonstationary persistent process satisfies smoothness moments. This theoretical framework enables us to extract the persistent part and test for conditional heteroskedasticity, detecting both stationary and persistent volatilities. Our approach accounts for Monte Carlo simulation and supports a strategy for empirical applications, challenging theprevailing persistent volatility paradigm. We uncover that stationary conditional heteroskedasticity is considerably less pronounced than previously thought.

2. In this work, we explore the properties of nonparametric Bayesian reversible diffusion processes with periodic drifts. The reversibility of the process is exploited to derive posterior contraction rates, leveraging the drift gradient vector field approximation. The theoretically induced priors, invariant under the Gaussian and exponential families, converge to the truth at the nonparametric rate of Sobolev smoothness. We propose a particle filter with weakly informative potentials and relative latent state dynamics, approximate time discretization, and the Feynman-Kac path integral framework. This leads to a natural approach for filtering and smoothing in continuous time, with indicative weakly informative beyond-context resampling schemes and systematic resampling techniques.

3. Systematic Stratified Sampling Procedure (SSP) sampling, in comparison to independent killing resampling, dominates the limiting overall resampling rate, resulting in reduced variance in numerical experiments. The finer time discretization allows for the identification of the continuous time limit expressed through a suitably infinitesimal generator. In contrast to generic generator modifications, SSP resampling exhibits a lower variance and intensity, manifesting a lower overall resampling rate. The proof relies on the particle approximation of the discretized Feynman-Kac path integral, which uniformly converges to a weighted continuous time particle system.
