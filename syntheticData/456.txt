The key component of spectral clustering, the combinatorial bound on the spectrum, can be analyzed using binary random matrices and the sharpening of conventional matrix Bernstein inequalities. The roughness regularization method can be used to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for regression prediction intervals and hypothesis testing for future responses. The asymptotic consistency of maximum likelihood estimators in dynamical systems with noise is shown, and the Gibbs axiom is employed to prove consistency. The universally least treatment of nuisance neighbors in left-right neighbor effects is identified, and asymmetric efficient treatments are derived. The detection of multi-aligned sparse signals involves constructing tests to achieve detectability and evaluating higher criticism tests. The empirical likelihood methodology in the irregularly spaced spatial frequency domain is formulated to account for the effect of the main Wilk phenomenon, and it can be used to build nonparametric asymptotically correct confidence regions and tests for covariance spectral equations.
