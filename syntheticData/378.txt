The test statistics are asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis, providing theoretical power and numerical effectiveness for testing purposes.

3. Fractional factorial designs are widely used in screening experiments due to their ability to minimize aberrations while maintaining geometric structure. The minimum aberration criterion is chosen based on the consideration of factor levels and their symbol representation. Quantitative factors are permuted to alter the geometrical structure, justifying the use of the minimum beta aberration criterion. This approach improves the efficiency of screening and reduces contamination from nonnegligible interactions, particularly when linear effects are increasing with run size. The unique minimum beta aberration criterion ensures the best level permutation, determined through an exhaustive search, provides the most practical benefit in experiments involving antiviral drug combinations.

4. Iterative imputation techniques have proven to be convenient and flexible, replacing potentially difficult multivariate modeling approaches. These techniques begin by characterizing the stationary iterative imputation property, accounting for conditional dependencies iteratively. The imputation process is based on a prespecified family of conditional distributions, ensuring compatibility and sufficiency. As the imputation converges, it exhibits total variation posterior Bayesian conditional incompatibility, validating the combined imputation approach. This method ensures consistency in the imputed data.

5. The use of the squared multiple correlation coefficient correction factor approximation allows for the construction of reliable confidence intervals for the coefficient ratio in high-dimensional data. This approach is particularly advantageous in non-Gaussian datasets and when employing linear mixed-effect models. The unbiased squared risk averaging criterion aids in selecting appropriate weights, leading to improved experimental results. The averaging method is asymptotically regular and has been experimentally proven to be superior, making it a valuable tool in clinical trials and other applications.
