Conditional spatiotemporal models offer advantages over traditional approaches by incorporating physical dynamical constraints more easily. These models can handle complex spatiotemporal covariance structures and incorporate multiresolution wavelet bases for computation. In meteorological research, combining satellite wind data with surface wind field data is essential for high-resolution global wind coverage.
