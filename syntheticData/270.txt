This graphical representation allows us to visualize the distribution of data and identify any values that fall outside the typical range. By setting lower and upper fences, we can determine the threshold for what constitutes an outlier. If a value falls below the lower fence or above the upper fence, it is considered an outlier. This approach ensures that the probability of encountering an outlier is minimized, adhering to a predetermined level of significance (alpha). However, it is essential to be mindful of the tolerance limit to avoid incorrectly labeling normal data points as outliers.
