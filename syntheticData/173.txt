3. The burgeoning domain of artificial intelligence has seen an upsurge in the embrace of unbiasedness as a quintessential attribute in analytical methodologies. This islargely predicated on the profound conceptual underpinnings of its utility. Nevertheless, biased estimators frequently contravene this fundamental tenet, leading to compromised outcomes. My study transcends conventional imputation methodologies by introducing a novel approach to alleviate the impact of missing data. This is accomplished through an amended version of the imputation kernel regression framework, which extends the applicability of the moment-based GMM estimator and inherits empirical likelihood properties. Extensive analytical examination of this method has been conducted, elucidating its asymptotic behaviors and differentiating it from extant methodologies that address missing data as a response variable.
