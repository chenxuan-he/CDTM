1. This study presents a novel approach to control systems, where the control size is selected arbitrarily and efficiency is prioritized. The method explores the trade-offs between control costs and time savings, utilizing sequential control connections for treatment allocation. By employing stochastic approximation sampling rules, the issue of width confidence intervals in sequential testing is addressed, enabling early stopping. This results in significant time and cost savings while still effectively answering control questions. The application of this method in computerized adaptive testing demonstrates its effectiveness in processing jobs in a predetermined order, considering both single-machine processes and evolving stochastic Markov chains. The reward earned from processing jobs is determined by the transition probabilities of the Markov chain, with the objective of maximizing the total expected reward within an extended time interval. The regret strategy is defined to minimize the shortfall in the maximum expected reward, ensuring that the method is equivalent to minimizing regret. This approach is characterized by its deterministic constraints and is constructed to achieve an asymptotic lower bound for regret, making it a uniformly good strategy in the presence of uncertainty.

2. In the realm of sequential control, a new technique has emerged that focuses on optimizing efficiency while managing control sizes chosen at random. This method, which emphasizes cost-saving and time-saving measures, employs a sequential control approach to allocate treatments. By utilizing stochastic sampling rules, it effectively resolves issues related to confidence interval width in sequential hypothesis testing, allowing for early termination when appropriate. This not only conserves time and resources but also provides comprehensive answers to control-related questions. The technique's utility in computerized adaptive testing is exemplified by its ability to process jobs in a predefined sequence, adapt to single-machine processes, and navigate stochastic Markov chains. The Markov chain's transition probabilities determine the rewards for job processing, with the aim of maximizing total expected rewards over an expanded time frame. The regret strategy introduced minimizes the gap between the maximum expected reward and the actual achieved reward, which is synonymous with minimizing regret. This technique is distinguished by its deterministic constraints and is designed to reach an asymptotic lower bound for regret, marking it as a strategy that is consistently effective in the face of uncertainty.
