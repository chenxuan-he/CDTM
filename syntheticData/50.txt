Maximum likelihood estimation is the primary method used to construct an explicit density function, providing a self-consistent power spectrum. This approach ensures that the posteriori density is correctly specified, and it allows for the precise reproduction of the main exact expressions. The self-consistent property is of great importance in applications, as it ensures that the prior density is not a subjective choice. The emergence of the cutoff frequency, akin to the bin size or kernel bandwidth, is a natural outcome of the derivation process. Achieving the theoretical limit of scaling and minimizing the square error size is a goal in supervised classification.
