1. This study presents a novel geostatistical approach for analyzing the spatial distribution of rock strata properties. The method accounts for the sharp changes in covariance structures and automatically decomposes the spatial domain into disjoint regions. The additive component of the model is based on nonparametric additive quantile regression, which provides asymptotically normally distributed rate convergence probabilities. The proposed method is applied to the analysis of soil permeability in the Schneider Buda oil field, Wood County, Texas. The model maintains flexibility while handling functional predictors and is extendable to generalized additive quantile regression. The empirical results demonstrate the usefulness of the method in modeling scalar functional predictors with high flexibility and adaptability.

2. In this work, we explore the application of Bayesian methods for eliciting subjective opinions in the context of modeling relationships between scalar functional predictors. The elicitation process is informed by the statistician's expertise and the subject matter expert's knowledge. We discuss the criteria for successful elicitation and argue that it is essential to faithfully represent the opinions of the individuals being elicited. The proposed hierarchical likelihood framework allows for the incorporation of prior beliefs and addresses the issue of ambiguity in judgment. The methodology is illustrated through a case study involving the analysis of arthritic bone shape.

The new method, called Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR), handles functional predictors by projecting them onto a suitable basis and maintaining flexibility. PPR is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data and can be easily extended to handle multiple functional predictors and missing data. The proposed method is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating its numerical usefulness and empirical application in the analysis of soil permeability data from the Schneider Buda oil field.

This study examines the role of Bayesian methods in eliciting subjective opinions and the potential biases that arise due to heuristic responses to uncertainty. We discuss the importance of involving the statistician, client, and subject matter expert in the elicitation process to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased representation of uncertainty. The hierarchical likelihood framework is used to integrate prior beliefs and facilitate the modeling process, ultimately improving the overall modeling outcomes.
