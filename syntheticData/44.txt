The field of excursion imaging spans a wide range of scientific disciplines, including neuroimaging, climatology, and cosmology. Despite the growing body of research, there is little published concerning the comparison process sampled across spatial regions. This reflects the asymptotically Gaussian random field acquired, with the aim of confidence statements intersecting or unionizing the excursion across the field's spatial region. The natural question arises as to whether the random field exceeds a predetermined threshold, and at least one region must exceed this threshold to assess the degree of spatial variability desired. A subset of this superset is the logical conjunction of intersection and disjunction, verified extensively and demonstrated in tasks such as fMRI, which identifies brain region activation in four variant working memory tasks.

Paragraph 2:
To address the challenge of intractable tests in generalizing kernel Stein discrepancy (ksd), a nonparametric test relative to the goodness of fit, Liu et al. (pp. Chwialkowski et al. proceeding rd international conference machine learning) and Yang (pp. Th international conference machine learning) proposed a method that exploits the latent structure in high-dimensional data. This test significantly outperforms the relative maximum discrepancy test by appropriately calibrating thresholds and controlling errors, making it suitable for low-dimensional latent structures.

Paragraph 3:
The Randomisation Interpreted (RI) test, interpreted as a Fisher sharp hypothesis test, ensures that the unit-level effect is exactly zero when the hypothesis is criticised as restrictive and implausible. Consequently, rejecting this hypothesis is scientifically uninteresting. However, by reinterpreting the RI test, it can expand its range and offer exact confidence intervals (CI) for the maximum and minimum unit-level effects.

The Markov property, imposed in time-corresponding tests, is of paramount importance in nonparametric testing, particularly in high-dimensional time-series data. Deep conditional generative learning techniques are employed to sequentially determine the order of Markov processes, controlling errors and achieving asymptotically powerful results. Proposing a doubly robust test, which employs nonparametric methods to achieve parametric convergence rates, the adoption of splitting cross-fitting ensures consistency and efficacy in test applications.

Paragraph 5:
The application of advanced deep generative learning models enables the approximation of conditional density functions, providing a sharp upper bound on error rates. These models are essential for inferring order in Markov processes, which is closely related to the Markov property. By utilising the state-of-the-art in deep generative learning, conditional density estimation becomes a cornerstone of nonparametric testing, offering a robust and powerful tool for exploring complex data structures and their underlying patterns.

Paragraph [Excursion imaging is a crucial aspect of various scientific fields, including neuroimaging, climatology, and cosmology. Despite the extensive research, there is a lack of published studies comparing the process of sampling across different spatial regions. The aim is to establish a confident statement regarding the intersection and union of excursion across a field. This intersection and union correspond to natural questions about the spatial variability of random fields exceeding a predetermined threshold. The objective is to assess the degree of spatial variability with a desired confidence level, utilizing a subset and superset of the spatial region in a logical conjunction. The dependence field has been extensively verified and demonstrated in tasks like fMRI, which identifies brain region activation in four variants of a working memory task.

A kernel nonparametric test is employed to compare the relative goodness of fit, aiming to address the issue of unobserved latent variables in an intractable test. The kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) test, as proposed by Liu et al. in the proceeding of the rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp., offers a solution. Yang et al. in their proceeding of the th International Conference on Machine Learning, pp., highlighted the importance of exploiting latent structures in high-dimensional tests to significantly outperform relative maximum discrepancy tests. This is achieved by properly calibrating thresholds and controlling errors in low-dimensional latent structures.

The Randomisation Interpreted (RI) test is interpreted as a Fisher sharp hypothesis test, ensuring that the unit-level effect is exactly zero. However, this hypothesis has been criticised for being restrictive and implausible, making rejection uninteresting scientifically. By reinterpreting the RI test, the range of exact confidence intervals (CIs) for the maximum and minimum unit-level effects can be expanded. This inverting test sequence allows for the validation of bounds on the generalised RI test, covering quantiles of individual effects. This simultaneously valid sense correction requires multiple analyses, summed up in a broader justification for randomisation tests.

The Markov property is imposed on time-correlated data, which is of paramount importance in nonparametric tests. The Markov property, relatedly, is crucial for inferring order in high-dimensional time-series data. By utilizing state-of-the-art deep generative learning, conditional density estimation is sharpened, providing an upper bound on approximation error. This doubly robust test employs nonparametric methods to achieve parametric convergence rates, adopting splitting and cross-fitting techniques to minimize required sample sizes and ensure consistency. The efficacy of this test application is demonstrated in various contexts.]

This test is properly calibrated and controls the error rate, ensuring that the threshold is maintained. By doing so, it provides a valid and robust approach for testing hypotheses in high-dimensional latent structures.

3. The Randomisation Interpreted (RI) test is a powerful method for hypothesis testing, particularly when dealing with unit-level effects. Unlike traditional tests that assume the effect is exactly zero, the RI test allows for more flexibility by considering non-positive and non-negative effects. This broader approach is more plausible and avoids the restrictive nature of the null hypothesis, making the rejection more scientifically interesting. The RI test can be reinterpreted to expand its range and cover quantiles of individual effects, providing a valid sense of correction for multiple analyses.

5. The adoption of splitting cross-fitting techniques ensures the consistency of the test while minimising the required sample size. This approach combines the efficacy of nonparametric testing with the advantages of parametric convergence rates. By employing conditional density estimation and deep conditional generative models, the test becomes robust and applicable in a wide range of scenarios. The application of these methods extends beyond traditional parametric testing, offering a broader justification for the use of nonparametric tests in statistical analysis.
