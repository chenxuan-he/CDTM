1. The use of knockoff statistics in social science research has significantly improved the performance of feature selection in machine learning algorithms. By constructing synthetic knockoffs, researchers can effectively control the expected proportion of false discoveries. This approach involves minimizing the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features. Surprisingly, minimizing the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) feature knockoff is often powerless. Instead, minimizing the Minimum Reconstructability (MRC) feature knockoff has proven to be more robust and powerful in controlling false discoveries.

2. The concept of goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests has become a ubiquitous tool in statistical analysis. These tests offer analysts great flexibility in hypothesis testing while still ensuring validity. Notable exceptions include the Composite Hypothesis Test and the Co-Sufficient Sampling (CSS) test, which guarantees valid GOF tests through resampling. However, the CSS test can be powerless in certain scenarios, such as logistic regression. To address this limitation, the Approximate CSS (ACSS) test was developed to quantify finite error inflation.

3. High-dimensional regression analysis aims to recover a sparse binary vector β from a noisy linear model. Theoretical results suggest that a sublinear sparsity regime, where the number of nonzero elements in β is proportional to the logarithm of the sample size, is required for successful recovery. However, the computational hardness of this regime has led to the development of various algorithms, such as the Lasso and Approximate Message Passing, which attempt to overcome these challenges.

4. The development of dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) has been a significant advancement in personalized medicine. These regimes involve a sequence of decision rules that map patient data to recommended treatments. Discovering optimal DTRs for diseases like depression is a challenging task, often addressed through penalized regression learning. By maximizing expected outcomes and implementing generalization error bounds, DTRs can lead to improved patient outcomes.

5. Network interference in treatment effects has gained popularity in causal inference. This approach models the exposure of individuals to treatments as vertices in an undirected graph, where the treatment assigned to one individual can affect the outcome of another connected individual. Analytical methods based on Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes and random graph models have shown promise in understanding and estimating these direct and indirect treatment effects.

1. Knockoff Statistics: A New Approach to Controlling False Discoveries in Feature Selection

Feature selection is a crucial step in machine learning algorithms, and controlling the expected proportion of false discoveries is essential. Constructing synthetic knockoff features effectively acts as a control in feature selection, minimizing the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features. However, it is surprising that the minimization of the maximum absolute correlation (MAC) in creating knockoffs is relatively powerless. Instead, minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoff features (MRC) has been shown to be more robust and powerful, particularly in Gaussian linear models with correlated and exchangeable features.

2. The Power of MRC Knockoffs in High-Dimensional Feature Selection

In the realm of machine learning, feature selection is paramount for performance, but controlling false discoveries can be challenging. Synthetic knockoffs offer a solution by acting as a control in the selection process. While minimizing the maximum absolute correlation (MAC) has been a popular approach, it is not as effective as minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoff features (MRC). This latter strategy has demonstrated its computational efficiency, robustness, and power, especially in dealing with Gaussian linear models and exchangeable feature settings.

3. Enhancing Machine Learning with MRC Knockoffs

Machine learning algorithms rely on feature selection to optimize performance, but the risk of false discoveries looms large. Synthetic knockoffs serve as a control mechanism in this process, with MRC knockoffs emerging as a computationally efficient and powerful method. By minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoffs, these techniques significantly outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs, particularly in Gaussian linear models with correlated features. Their effectiveness stems from creating joint dependencies between the knockoffs and the machine learning algorithm's response feature.

4. The Advantages of MRC Knockoffs in Feature Selection for Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms can benefit greatly from proper feature selection, but the challenge lies in controlling false discoveries. Synthetic knockoffs provide a solution by acting as a control in the feature selection process. Among the different knockoff strategies, MRC knockoffs have shown to be superior, especially in Gaussian linear models with correlated features. These knockoffs minimize the reconstructability of the original features, enhancing the power of the machine learning algorithm and improving the generation of knockoffs with minimal reconstructability.

5. The Superiority of MRC Knockoffs in High-Dimensional Feature Selection

In the field of machine learning, feature selection is vital, yet controlling false discoveries remains a significant challenge. Synthetic knockoffs are a valuable tool in this context, and MRC knockoffs have proven to be particularly effective. By minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoffs, these techniques have shown to be more robust and powerful than MAC-minimizing knockoffs, especially in Gaussian linear models with correlated and exchangeable features. Their computational efficiency and power make them a valuable asset in the feature selection process for machine learning algorithms.

1. **Knockoff Statistics in Machine Learning and Feature Selection**

The integration of knockoff statistics in machine learning algorithms is proving to be a powerful tool for feature selection, offering provable control over the expected proportion of false discoveries. By constructing synthetic knockoffs that effectively act as controls for feature selection, researchers can minimize the absolute correlation between features. This method is particularly effective when dealing with Gaussian linear models with correlated and exchangeable features, where the key lies in minimizing the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC). The Minimum Reconstructability Criterion (MRC) knockoff, on the other hand, minimizes the notion of error and has been shown to be computationally efficient, robust, and powerful, especially in extensive Gaussian linear models. Implementations such as the Python package knockpy provide a practical approach to finite False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple testing scenarios with dependent tests, where the dependence is calibrated separately to adjust rejection thresholds.

2. **Robust Estimation in Survival Analysis with Censoring**

Survival analysis presents unique challenges when dealing with right-censored lifetime data. Traditional univariate methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier product limit, struggle to capture the joint probability density of survival times. Advanced methodologies are required to address the issue of censoring and to develop sharp, minimax adaptive nonparametric estimators for joint density. These methods integrate squared error through the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) criterion and work in tandem with survival theory to construct valid joint density estimates, accounting for the complexities introduced by bivariate censoring.

3. **Valid Instrumental Variables for Treatment Effect Estimation**

The use of instrumental variables (IVs) is crucial in overcoming treatment effect estimation challenges arising from unobserved confounders. However, the selection of valid IVs from multiple candidates can be complex, and previous reinforcement techniques have enabled the identification of nearly independent valid IVs. These methods allow for the performance of evidence factor validity analyses without the imposition of order or stratification, making them applicable in various contexts such as evaluating the causal effect of education on future earnings or the impact of malaria on child stunting in Western Kenya. The construction of approximate evidence factors through multiple strategies is a free-order imposition approach that leverages the utility of balanced blocking in instrumental analysis.

4. **Randomization Tests and High-Dimensional Asymptotic Theory**

The properties of randomization tests, including consistency and invariance, are well-understood, but their consistency invariance is less so. Assuming a signal-plus-noise transform, permutation, and rotation invariance, these tests can detect sparse signals at the minimax rate, as supported by extensive asymptotic theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The Gaussian bootstrap approximation plays a key role in high-dimensional settings by taking the maximum component sum of independent random vectors. This approach leads to improved iterative randomized Lindeberg bounds on distributional approximation errors, substantially enhancing the accuracy of high-dimensional testing.

5. **Rank Aggregation and Noisy Mallow Mixtures**

Rank aggregation is a fundamental problem in statistics, often complicated by the presence of noise. Noisy Mallow mixtures, which are characterized by their complexity proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements, can be efficiently learned in polynomial time. This method improves upon previous scale-based approaches and performs well in high-noise regimes. By characterizing the dependency complexity on noise, the objective of separating the noisy Mallow mixture is accomplished through the study of demixing permutations. This work also extends the noisy Mallow model to simulate a noiseless oracle, facilitating pairwise comparisons and moment-based mixing.

1. Feature selection in machine learning often involves controlling the expected proportion of false discoveries. This can be achieved by constructing synthetic knockoffs that effectively act as a control for feature selection. Knockoffs are constructed to minimize the absolute correlation between features, but surprisingly, this approach is often powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlated exchangeable features. The key to minimizing the absolute correlation is to create joint dependency between the knockoff features. This method has been shown to improve the power of feature selection by generating knockoffs that minimize reconstructability.

2. The proposal of using Gaussian feature knockoffs has shown to be computationally efficient and robust. By minimizing the notion of error, extensive testing has shown that the Gaussian linear extensive knockoff dramatically outperforms the minimization of absolute correlation. Implementing knockoffs in a Python package called knockpy has made it easier to control the false discovery rate in multiple tests with dependent tests. This package separately calibrates dependent rejection thresholds to relax or tighten the threshold, targeting exact false discovery rate control.

3. The knockoff method has been shown to empirically control the false discovery rate in dependent tests, performing comparably to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. The knockoff method is theoretically more powerful than the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure, which is a conservative adjustment for worst-case dependence. The knockoff method offers a substantial power gain over competitors, making it applicable in genome-wide association studies.

4. High-dimensional stochastic continuum armed bandits deal with the expected reward in the presence of additive beta sparsity. The rate of convergence to the optimal solution is directly related to the sparsity level of beta. The minimax regret rate of linear algorithms is logarithmic in the number of arms, with a lower bound on the adaptivity cost. The smoothness of the reward function implies that adaptation is free, but it is structurally adaptive. Additional self-similarity in the adaptive construction allows for simultaneous achievement of minimax regret over a range of smoothness levels.

5. Modern neural networks operate in a strongly overparametrized regime, where the training labels are replaced by purely random labels. Despite achieving good prediction error on unseen data, the generalization error overparametrization is beneficial in simplifying the optimization landscape. In the neural tangent kernel regime, the main characterization is that the minimum eigenvalue of the empirical neural tangent kernel is bounded away from zero. This implies that the network can exactly interpolate arbitrary labels in this regime. The characterization of the generalization error is related to the test error, which can be approximated by kernel ridge regression. As the regularization increases, the self-induced high-degree component activation leads to a polynomial degree size in the dimension.

1. The knockoff filter is a statistical method that aids in feature selection for machine learning algorithms. It controls the expected proportion of false discoveries by constructing synthetic knockoffs that effectively act as controls. The key to minimizing the absolute correlation of the knockoffs with the original feature is to create knockoffs that minimize the Maximum Absurdity Criterion (MAC). Surprisingly, knockoffs that minimize the MAC are powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlation, while those that minimize the Reconstructability Minimization Criterion (MRC) are robust and powerful. This proposal presents a computationally efficient and robust knockoff filter that minimizes the MRC, significantly outperforming MAC-minimizing knockoffs and MRC-minimizing knockoffs by a slight margin.

2. Implementing the knockoff filter in a Python package called knockpy allows for finite False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple hypothesis testing under dependence. The knockpy package separately calibrates the dependent rejection threshold for each hypothesis, relaxing the tight thresholding to target exact FDR control. The Dependence-Adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) threshold offers a concrete algorithm for FDR control under dependence, uniformly dominating the standard Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. The dbh threshold is particularly useful for controlling FDR in genome-wide association studies.

3. The knockoff filter is not only beneficial for controlling FDR but also performs comparably to the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of power. By empirically and theoretically controlling FDR under dependence, the knockoff filter demonstrates extensive advantages in applications such as genome-wide association studies. The knockoff filter offers a novel approach to handling dependent tests, providing a valuable tool for researchers in various fields.

4. The knockoff filter has been shown to effectively control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple testing under dependence. By separately calibrating the dependent rejection threshold for each hypothesis, the knockoff filter relaxes the tight thresholding, targeting exact FDR control. This concrete algorithm for FDR control under dependence, known as the Dependence-Adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) threshold, uniformly dominates the standard Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. The knockoff filter has demonstrated its effectiveness in applications such as genome-wide association studies, offering a valuable tool for controlling FDR in dependent tests.

5. The knockoff filter is a powerful tool for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in multiple testing under dependence. It achieves this by separately calibrating the dependent rejection threshold for each hypothesis, relaxing the tight thresholding to target exact FDR control. The Dependence-Adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) threshold offers a concrete algorithm for FDR control under dependence, uniformly dominating the standard Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. The knockoff filter has been successfully applied in various fields, such as genome-wide association studies, and has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling FDR in dependent tests.

1. The construction of knockoff statistics for social series statistical methods and algorithms involves feature selection in nearly all machine learning algorithms. This control involves creating synthetic knockoffs to effectively regulate the expected proportion of false discoveries. The process of constructing knockoffs is crucial in minimizing the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features, and surprisingly, the minimization of the maximum absolute correlation (MAC) can be extremely effective. However, minimizing the MAC is not always powerful enough to control feature selection, as demonstrated by the knockoff's inability to address Gaussian linear correlated and exchangeable features. The key is to minimize the MAC by creating joint dependencies between the features, allowing the knockoff machine learning algorithm to reconstruct the effect of the feature response. By minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoff features, the proposal of using Gaussian features shows that the minimax reconstruction error (MRC) knockoff is computationally efficient, robust, and powerful. The MRC knockoff significantly outperforms the MAC minimizing knockoff and the MRC minimizing knockoff outperforms the MAC minimizing knockoff by a slight margin. This implementation is available in the Python package knockpy.

2. Censoring in survival analysis presents a unique challenge, as the bivariate cumulative distribution function and right-censored lifetime data cannot be fully captured by the traditional univariate product limit or Kaplan-Meier methodologies. A new methodology is proposed that yields the joint probability density of the survival times, taking into account the presence of censoring. This methodology sharpens the minimax adaptive nonparametric estimation of the joint density, with integrated squared error as the criterion. By integrating the joint density estimation with the theory of survival analysis, the proposed methodology provides a practical and valid approach to handling censoring in survival data.

3. The selection of treatment effects in the presence of unobserved confounders can be biased when using multiple candidate instruments. To address this issue, a valid instrumental variable analysis is conducted to enable nearly independent valid analysis. The crucial step is to conduct multiple instrumental analyses in a balanced factorial design, which ensures orthogonality and balance. This strategy can be applied to evaluate the effect of education on future earnings, the causal effect of malaria stunting in children in western Kenya, and other nested instrumental variables. The balanced block design allows for the evaluation of causal effects in the presence of treatment disruptions or world events, such as World War II.

4. The consistency and invariance properties of randomization tests, permutation tests, and rotation tests are well-understood, but the consistency of invariance properties in randomization tests is much less understood. Assuming the drawn signal plus noise transform under permutation and rotation, the compact topological rotation acts as a linear representation of the test. The generalized subadditivity property is fundamental and highly relevant for the detection of sparse signals in high-dimensional data. The minimax lower bound for sparse signal detection can be achieved by randomization tests, with the minimax rate being surprisingly low. The key role of the maximum component sum of independent random vectors in high-dimensional testing is explored, along with the application of iterative randomized Lindeberg bounds for distributional approximation and error bound improvement.

5. Rank aggregation using Mallows mixtures and permutations is a common approach, especially in high-dimensional settings. A polynomial-time algorithm is proposed to learn Mallows mixtures from permutations, with the element complexity being proportional to the logarithm of the number of elements. This approach significantly improves upon previous scale-free methods and performs well in high-noise regimes. The dependency complexity and noise objective are characterized by studying the demixing of permutations from a noiseless oracle, which is achieved through pairwise comparisons. This analysis extends the noisy Mallows mixture simulation to a noiseless oracle, allowing for precise moment estimation and enabling the characterization of noiseless query complexity.

1. Synthetic knockoffs effectively control feature selection in machine learning algorithms by constructing knockoffs that minimize absolute correlation between features. This approach surprisingly lacks power in highly correlated Gaussian linear models. However, minimizing the Maximum Average Correlation (MAC) creates joint dependencies among features, which improves the power of generating knockoffs. The Minimum Reconstructability (MRC) feature selection proposal minimizes the notion of error in Gaussian linear models, showing computationally efficient and robust performance.

2. The knockoff framework has been extended to control the false discovery rate (FDR) in multiple hypothesis testing, particularly in dependent tests. By separately calibrating dependent rejection thresholds, the knockoff approach can empirically control FDR and perform comparably to the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure in a finite sample setting. The knockoff framework also outperforms the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) correction for positively dependent tests.

3. Randomization tests, such as permutation tests and rotation tests, draw weak inference and error control properties from their invariance under signal plus noise transformations. While the consistency property of randomization tests is well-understood, their invariance properties, especially under linear representations, are less explored. The generalized subadditivity property is a fundamental characteristic that holds for highly sparse vectors in detection tests, such as linear regression with low-rank matrices.

4. In high-dimensional rank aggregation problems, Mallows models with permutation heterogeneity can be efficiently learned using a polynomial-time algorithm. This approach improves upon previous methods in the high noise regime and characterizes the dependency complexity between noisy Mallows models. By simulating a noiseless oracle, the method achieves moment demixing and extends the noisy Mallows model to pairwise comparisons.

5. Modern neural networks operate in an overparametrized regime, where they interpolate training data with actual labels replaced by purely random ones. Despite this, they achieve good prediction errors on unseen data. The neural tangent kernel regime offers a characterization of generalization errors in overparametrized neural networks, with implications for the minimum eigenvalue of the empirical neural tangent kernel and its boundedness away from zero. This analysis connects to the double descent behavior of prediction risk in overparametrized models.

1. The utilization of knockoff statistics in the realm of social series statistics and statistical methodology involves the performance of feature selection, which is integral to most machine learning algorithms. The technique of constructing synthetic knockoffs serves as a powerful tool in controlling the expected proportion of false discoveries. The effectiveness of the knockoff method is showcased through its ability to minimize the absolute correlation between the feature knockoff and the original feature. However, the knockoff method may become ineffective in highly correlated Gaussian linear models. The key lies in minimizing the maximal absolute correlation (MAC) to create joint dependencies between features. Reconstructing the effect of the feature on the response variable through knockoffs can significantly improve the power of the method. Furthermore, minimizing the reconstructability of the minimum reconstruction correlation (MRC) feature can lead to computationally efficient and robust knockoffs. Extensive studies using MRC knockoffs have demonstrated their superiority over MAC-minimizing knockoffs, with a slight margin of outperformance. The knockpy Python package offers an implementation of the knockoff method, providing finite false discovery rate (FDR) control for multiple tests with dependent test statistics. The package separately calibrates the dependent rejection thresholds, allowing for the relaxation or tightening of the threshold to target exact FDR control. The dependence-adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (DBH) threshold and the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) log correction are both options within the package, with the former uniformly dominating the latter in terms of power. The knockoff method, when applied with the DBH threshold, performs comparably to the BY method and offers substantial power gains over methods that do not account for dependence.

2. The application of censored quantile regression (CQR) has become increasingly valuable for analyzing associations with potentially censored outcomes. However, the computation of CQR poses challenges, especially at scale. To address this, researchers have focused on developing smoothed martingale-based sequential equations and scalable gradient algorithms that offer a theoretically unified approach. These methods relax the exponential sparsity assumption inherent in traditional CQR, resulting in improved performance, particularly in high-dimensional settings. The use of multiplier bootstrap in high-dimensional sparse data significantly enhances the accuracy of CQR estimates. Simulated experiments and real-world applications have demonstrated the efficacy of the smoothed CQR approach, which leverages martingale-based methods to provide a more robust and efficient solution to the regression problem under censoring.

3. The concept of pattern graphs, specifically directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), has gained prominence in the field of nonparametric identification. These DAGs serve to represent response patterns and the identifying restrictions in a nonparametric manner. Pattern graphs are particularly useful for handling saturated models with missing data and random restrictions. By employing pattern graphs, researchers can impose identifying restrictions in a flexible and nonparametric way, thus expanding the range of models that can be estimated consistently in the presence of complex dependencies and unobserved confounding. The development of methods for nonparametrically identified models with pattern graphs has been a significant advancement in statistical theory, offering a broader framework for analyzing causal relationships in the absence of restrictive parametric assumptions.

4. The local Fréchet regression is a nonparametric regression technique suitable for metric space-valued responses with Euclidean predictors. It is particularly useful for modeling smooth trajectories in noisy metric spaces. The method achieves uniform rate convergence, which has been elusive in theoretical treatments of random target trajectories. By utilizing empirical process tools applicable to metric space-valued random objects, local Fréchet regression can consistently locate the trajectory's minimum and properly estimate its extrema. This technique finds applications in various fields, such as locating the age of minimum brain connectivity in FMRI data and warping metric space-valued trajectories for annual age at death across different countries. The flexibility and robustness of local Fréchet regression make it a valuable tool for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data in a nonparametric framework.

5. The goodness-of-fit (GOF) test is a ubiquitous tool in statistical analysis, used for model selection, confidence interval construction, and conditional independence testing, among other applications. Analysts have great flexibility in choosing GOF tests, ensuring validity while accommodating various needs. A notable exception is the composite hypothesis, which must be tractable over the entire space. The conditional sufficient sampling (CSS) resampling approach guarantees the validity of GOF tests, providing a compact theoretical framework. CSS tests are powerful due to their leverage on the concept of approximate sufficiency. The approximate CSS (ACSS) test quantifies the finite error inflation, while the vanishing maximum likelihood asymptotic choice test offers theoretical finite error control and power. These tests provide analysts with a range of tools to validate models and hypotheses in a statistically sound manner, even in high-dimensional and complex settings.

1. Constructing synthetic knockoffs has emerged as a powerful method for controlling false discovery in feature selection for machine learning algorithms. By effectively acting as a control for feature selection, knockoffs allow for the construction of a null distribution that can minimize the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features. This approach is particularly useful in the context of Gaussian linear models with correlated and exchangeable features. Minimizing the maximal absolute correlation (MAC) between original and knockoff features is crucial in creating joint dependencies. However, it is surprising that MAC-minimizing knockoffs are relatively powerless in controlling false discoveries, as they can be easily fooled by Gaussian linear models with correlated exchangeable features. The key to effective knockoffs lies in minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoff features, as demonstrated by the MRC (Minimal Reconstructability Criterion) knockoffs. These knockoffs are computationally efficient, robust, and powerful, as evidenced by their performance in Gaussian feature models. The MRC knockoffs significantly outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs and show a slight margin of improvement over MRC knockoffs. The knockpy Python package implements knockoffs and allows for finite false discovery rate (FDR) control in multiple testing scenarios, accounting for dependent tests through separate calibration of the rejection threshold.

2. The Bradley-Terry-Luce model for ranking players based on partial pairwise comparisons has been widely used. However, the minimax rate of ranking based on the Kendall's tau distance between the true and estimated rank vectors has not been fully characterized. The minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition from an exponential rate to a polynomial rate, depending on the magnitude of the signal-to-noise ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is unique in the context of full ranking, where the minimax rate can be achieved by a divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm. This algorithm divides the players into groups, computes the local maximum likelihood estimate within each group, and carefully approximates the independence between the groups. This step is crucial for achieving the minimax rate. The approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm has been widely used in various applications, including principal component analysis. The precise Onsager correction and state evolution property of AMP algorithms for random matrix ensembles are key to its success. When applied to white noise matrices, the AMP algorithm satisfies the orthogonal and rotational invariance laws, and its limiting spectral distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law. The Onsager correction in the state evolution algorithm allows for the computation of free cumulants and spectra. Previous work by Opper, Cakmak, and Winther introduced a non-rigorous dynamic functional theory technique, which has been rigorously proven in this paper. The application of the Bayesian AMP algorithm with a principal component prior structure is motivated by the fact that it can achieve higher accuracy in the presence of non-white noise and sufficiently strong signals.

3. Flexible and nonparametric learning tools, such as the random forest algorithm, have gained popularity due to their appealing empirical performance in high-dimensional feature spaces. The ability to uncover underlying mechanisms has led to recent theoretical consistency results for random forest algorithms. Variants of random forest, such as knowledge-based forests, have shown promising consistency rates in high dimensions. The modified random forest algorithm, which uses a splitting rule independent of the response, generates binary features and exhibits light consistency rates. The original random forest algorithm uses the CART splitting criterion and is known for its high-dimensional nonparametric regression capabilities. The bias-variance decomposition theory suggests that random forests are indeed adaptive to high dimensionality and can handle discontinuities in regression biases. The size of the trees and column subsampling are current limitations of the algorithm.

4. High-dimensional stochastic continuum-armed bandits are a class of online decision-making problems where the goal is to maximize the expected reward by adaptively choosing among a set of actions. The additive beta-minimax regret algorithms are designed to achieve this goal by minimizing the regret, which is the difference between the expected reward of the best fixed action and the expected reward of the chosen action. These algorithms achieve a convergence rate of O(√(βT)) and are characterized by their adaptivity and lower bound on the regret. The smoothness of the reward function implies a lower bound on the adaptivity, while the cost of adaptation is related to the smoothness level. The structural adaptive additive scab algorithm is constructed to achieve minimax regret across a range of smoothness levels and simultaneously construct self-similarity adaptive algorithms. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through minimax regret analysis and numerical simulations.

5. High-dimensional asymptotic theory has been applied to boosting algorithms to understand their performance in the overparametrized regime. By taking a computational perspective, the theory examines how weak learners in high-dimensional feature spaces scale with the size of the overparametrized regime. The exact generalization error of the boosting algorithm can be characterized by interpolating the training data and explicitly relating the empirical margin to the test error. The relation to the Bayes error and the proportion of active features in the interpolation process can be precisely characterized. Initialization with zero weights and the use of Gaussian comparison techniques and uniform deviation arguments enable the handling of finite rank spiked covariance features. The final component of the boosting geometry, the Lindeberg principle, showcases universality and the scaled margin asymptotically remains invariant, regardless of whether boosting arises from nonlinear random features or appropriately linearized matching moments.

1. The use of knockoff statistics in social science research has led to significant advancements in statistical methodology, particularly in the area of feature selection. By constructing synthetic data sets that effectively control the expected proportion of false discoveries, knockoff statistics have become a valuable tool in machine learning algorithms. The minimization of the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features is crucial in this process, as it ensures the knockoff features are powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlations. The key to creating effective knockoffs lies in minimizing the maximum absolute correlation, which can be achieved by generating knockoffs that minimize reconstructability. This approach has shown to be computationally efficient, robust, and powerful, as evidenced by its superior performance compared to methods that minimize the absolute correlation.

2. The development of knockoff statistics for feature selection has been an important advancement in machine learning algorithms. By generating synthetic knockoffs that minimize the reconstructability of the original features, knockoffs effectively control the expected proportion of false discoveries. The minimization of the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) between the original and knockoff features is a key aspect of this approach, as it ensures that the knockoffs are powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlations. However, it has been observed that minimizing MAC alone may not be sufficient, and that minimizing the reconstructability (MRC) of the knockoffs is crucial for achieving optimal performance. This has led to the proposal of using Gaussian knockoffs that minimize the MRC, which has been shown to be computationally efficient, robust, and powerful.

3. The application of knockoff statistics in feature selection has revolutionized machine learning algorithms, offering provable control over the expected proportion of false discoveries. Constructing synthetic knockoffs that effectively act as a control for feature selection is a cornerstone of this approach. To achieve this, the knockoffs must minimize the absolute correlation between the original and knockoff features. However, minimizing the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) alone may not be sufficient, as it can be surprisingly powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlations. To address this, the Minimum Reconstructability (MRC) of the knockoffs must also be minimized, which has been shown to be a computationally efficient, robust, and powerful approach. By generating knockoffs that minimize the MRC, the joint dependency between the original and knockoff features is effectively controlled, leading to improved power and performance in machine learning algorithms.

1. Feature selection plays a crucial role in machine learning algorithms, and controlling the expected proportion of false discoveries is paramount. Constructing synthetic knockoffs effectively acts as a control for feature selection, with the goal of minimizing the absolute correlation between the knockoff and the original feature. This approach is particularly powerless in the presence of Gaussian linear correlated exchangeable features. The key lies in minimizing the maximal correlation coefficient (MAC) to create joint dependency among the knockoffs. By minimizing the MAC, we can significantly improve the power of feature selection in machine learning algorithms.

2. Gaussian feature knockoffs have shown to be computationally efficient, robust, and powerful. The minimal reconstructability criterion (MRC) knockoff minimizes the notion of error in Gaussian linear models and has been extensively shown to outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs. Implementing knockoffs in a Python package, such as knockpy, allows for finite false discovery rate (FDR) control in multiple testing scenarios, taking into account dependent tests and calibrating rejection thresholds. This approach provides a relaxed and tightened threshold to target exact FDR control, with the algorithmic dependence-adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) threshold outperforming the traditional Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) threshold.

3. Bivariate cumulative survival analysis presents unique challenges that cannot be addressed by univariate methods. The Kaplan-Meier methodology, while valuable, does not yield the joint probability density of survival times. Survival theory methodology that incorporates censoring can provide sharp, minimax adaptive nonparametric joint density estimates, integrated squared error (ISE), and misclassification (MISE) criterion theory. Analyzing the joint density, along with bivariate censoring effects, is crucial in practical applications and necessitates valid statistical techniques to enable accurate treatment effect selection.

4. The selection of valid instruments is crucial in overcoming treatment effect estimation challenges due to biased unobserved confounders. Multiple candidate instruments, some possibly invalid, require careful analysis. The use of instrumental variables (IV) analysis can enable nearly independent valid analysis performance. The order of multiple IV analysis is critical, and conducting them in an orthogonal and balanced factorial design, possibly with nested candidate instruments, can be applied in various scenarios. For example, evaluating the effect of education on future earnings or the causal effect of malaria on stunting in children in Western Kenya.

5. The consistency and invariance properties of randomization tests, such as permutation tests and rotation tests, are not well understood. Assuming the data is a signal plus noise transform, permutation and rotation act as compact topological transformations, preserving linear representations. The generalized subadditivity property is fundamental and highly relevant in the context of sparse vector detection in low-rank matrices with noise. Randomization tests have been shown to detect signals at near-minimax rates, challenging the conventional wisdom that they are less powerful than parametric alternatives.

1. The knockoff feature selection technique in statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms is a method that involves the construction of synthetic knockoff variables to control the expected proportion of false discoveries. This approach is effective in managing feature selection and minimizing the absolute correlation between the knockoff feature and the original. It is surprising to note that the knockoff feature can be almost powerless, especially in the presence of Gaussian linear correlation and exchangeable features. The key to maximizing its effectiveness lies in minimizing the maximum absolute correlation (MAC) to create joint dependencies. The knockoff feature selection in machine learning algorithms can reconstruct the effect of feature-response, thereby enhancing its power. By minimizing the reconstructability (MRC) of the feature, the proposal introduces a computationally efficient, robust, and powerful MRC knockoff, which minimizes the notion of error in Gaussian linear correlation and outperforms the MAC minimizing knockoff.

2. The implementation of the knockoff feature selection in the Python package knockpy allows for finite false discovery rate (FDR) control in multiple testing with dependent tests. This package separately calibrates the dependent rejection thresholds, relaxing the tight threshold to target exact FDR control. The concrete algorithm for dependence-adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) thresholding and the relaxed Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) thresholding are proposed. The BH adjusted hypothesis test uniformly dominates the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) test in terms of controlling FDR under dependence. The dbh thresholding is shown to uniformly dominate the BY test and the BH test with log correction, which is a conservative adjustment for the worst-case dependence. This approach results in a substantial power gain over competitors and is applicable to various settings, including genome-wide association studies.

3. The bivariate cumulative pair right-censored lifetime data analysis presents an unparalleled challenge in survival theory. The traditional univariate product limit and Kaplan-Meier methodologies do not yield the joint probability density. The proposed methodology sharpens the minimax adaptive nonparametric estimation of the joint density using the integrated squared error (ISE) criterion. This approach accounts for the impact of bivariate censoring on the presence of censoring in practice. It provides valid instrumental variables that enable the selection of treatment effects, accounting for treatment biases due to unobserved confounders and multiple candidate instruments that may be invalid. The use of previously reinforced instruments enables nearly independent valid analyses. This is crucial for performing evidence factor validity analyses, especially when multiple instrumental analyses are conducted with orthogonality and balanced factorial designs.

4. The concept of pattern graphs, represented by directed acyclic graphs, is an innovative approach for identifying response patterns. A pattern graph can represent identifying restrictions nonparametrically, handling saturated missing data and random restrictions. This methodology provides a flexible framework for identifying complex patterns in high-dimensional data, offering an alternative to traditional parametric models. It allows for the identification of response patterns that may not be captured by standard parametric approaches, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying data structure. Pattern graphs have the potential to be a valuable tool in various fields, including bioinformatics, social sciences, and finance, where the identification of complex patterns is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making.

5. The application of rank correlation in testing the independence of pairs of random ranks has found innovative applications in the past decade. This approach is particularly appealing for continuous testing and becomes free from the traditional concept of rank, which relies on ordering and handling tied data in univariate analysis. The construction of a free consistent test for the independence of random vectors is addressed by leveraging the concept of center outward rank and its multivariate generalization. The center outward rank testIndependence extends the multivariate Hajek asymptotic representation, which permits direct calculation of the limiting distribution and facilitates local power analysis. This test has been shown to have strong support in the neighborhood of the root and establishes nontrivial power in the presence of dependence. The center outward rank testIndependence is a valuable tool for detecting dependencies in high-dimensional data, offering a computationally efficient and statistically efficient alternative to traditional methods.

It controls the expected proportion of false discoveries by constructing synthetic knockoffs that effectively act as controls in feature selection. The goal is to minimize the absolute correlation between the feature knockoffs, which surprisingly have little power in Gaussian linear models with correlated exchangeable features. The key is to minimize the maximum correlation coefficient (MAC) to create joint dependency in the feature knockoffs, which can reconstruct the effect of the feature response. The proposal is to use Gaussian features, which are computationally efficient, robust, and powerful in minimizing the reconstruction error (MRC). Extensive simulation results show that MRC knockoffs dramatically outperform MAC minimizing knockoffs, with MRC knockoffs slightly outperforming MRC knockoffs.

The smoothed CQR has a penalized counterpart with increasing dimension, offering uniform convergence rates across a range of quantile indices. The validity of the method is rigorously justified, and the multiplier bootstrap significantly improves the performance of CQR, especially when relaxing the exponential sparsity assumption.

This approach is particularly effective in scenarios where the selection of features is crucial, as it minimizes the absolute correlation between the knockoff and the original features. However, knockoffs constructed to minimize the maximum absolute correlation (MAC) can be surprisingly powerless. By focusing on minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoffs (MRC), a more computationally efficient and robust feature selection method can be achieved, as demonstrated by the Gaussian feature setup.

2. The development of knockoffs for feature selection in machine learning has led to the generation of powerful tools for controlling false discoveries.

This latter approach has shown to be computationally efficient and robust, especially when dealing with Gaussian linear models. The Python package knockpy offers an implementation of this MRC knockoff method for use in multiple test scenarios.

This method involves minimizing the absolute correlation between features and the knockoffs, which is crucial in machine learning algorithms. The minimization of the Maximum Angle Deviation (MAC) between features and knockoffs plays a key role in controlling feature selection, with surprising results showing the ineffectiveness of MAC-minimizing knockoffs. On the other hand, minimizing the Reconstructability (MRC) of features leads to more robust and powerful knockoffs, as demonstrated by Gaussian feature experiments.

2. The knockoff framework is implemented in the Python package knockpy, which offers finite False Discovery Rate (fdr) control for multiple hypothesis testing, handling dependent tests separately by calibrating dependent rejection thresholds. This approach relaxes the tight thresholding and aims to target exact fdr control. The knockoff framework outperforms the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure, especially in the presence of strong dependence, as it empirically controls fdr and performs comparably to the dependent BH (dbh) procedure.

3. In survival analysis, the bivariate cumulative hazard product limit method addresses the challenge of right-censored lifetime data, providing a joint probability density estimation. This methodology, rooted in survival theory, offers a sharp minimax adaptive nonparametric approach to joint density estimation, integrating squared error to optimize the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) criterion. The methodology accounts for the impact of bivariate censoring, which affects the presence of censoring in practical applications.

4. Valid instrumental variables are essential for treatment effect estimation, as they enable the selection of unbiased treatments while accounting for unobserved confounders. Multiple candidate instruments, some possibly invalid, can be strengthened through reinforcement to achieve nearly independent valid analysis. The order of multiple instrumental analyses is crucial when conducted orthogonally, and strategies such as balanced blocking can be applied to evaluate causal effects, as seen in the context of education disruption and its impact on future earnings.

1. In recent years, the knockoff statistic has gained attention for its role in controlling the expected proportion of false discoveries in feature selection for machine learning algorithms. This involves creating synthetic knockoffs to effectively manage the feature selection process. The minimization of the absolute correlation of the feature knockoffs is crucial, with the surprising realization that minimizing the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) feature knockoffs can be ineffective. Instead, minimizing the Minimum Reconstructability (MRC) feature knockoffs has proven to be a more robust and computationally efficient approach. The MRC knockoffs minimize the notion of error in Gaussian linear models and have been shown to significantly outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs. Implementing these knockoffs is made easier with the Python package knockpy, which allows for finite False Discovery Rate (FDR) control in multiple testing scenarios, even when tests are dependent.

2. Censored quantile regression (CQR) has emerged as a valuable tool for analyzing heterogeneous associations, especially when outcomes are possibly censored. The computation of CQR has been a challenge, especially at scale. Focusing on smoothed martingale estimating equations and scalable gradient algorithms, CQR can theoretically achieve unified smoothed sequential penalized regression. Its performance is particularly notable in high-dimensional settings, where it offers sublinear convergence rates and uniform convergence rates across quantile indices. The validity of CQR is rigorously justified through the multiplier bootstrap, which significantly improves performance in high-dimensional sparse data. Furthermore, relaxed exponential sparsity assumptions in CQR provide advantages in simulated experiments and real-world applications.

3. The analysis of cointegration in vector autoregressive (VAR) processes involves examining the VAR order in the presence of cointegration. Modifications to the Johansen likelihood ratio test, such as finite sample corrections, can help mitigate issues with overrejection. Achieving asymptotic results relies on the eigenvalue distribution of the test regime, which grows proportionally. Both theoretical support and empirical illustrations back these modifications. Moreover, there is a surprising connection between multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and the emergence of these modifications, shedding light on the underlying statistical mechanisms.

4. The ranking of players through partial pairwise comparisons, as seen in the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, presents a unique challenge in terms of minimax rate ranking. The Kendall's tau distance and the difference in rank vectors are metrics used to measure the performance of ranking algorithms. The minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition from an exponential rate to a polynomial rate, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio. This phenomenon is believed to be unique in achieving the minimax rate for full ranking. A divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm that divides players by skill and computes local maximum likelihood estimates within optimal groups offers a careful approximation of independence. This approach provides a robust strategy for ranking in the presence of partial information.

5. The study of goodness-of-fit (GOF) tests has wide applications, from model selection to confidence interval construction and conditional independence testing. Analysts have great flexibility in choosing GOF tests while ensuring validity. Conditional Sufficient Sampling (CSS) is a resampling method that guarantees valid GOF tests. An extension of CSS, Approximate Conditional Sufficient Sampling (ACSS), quantifies finite error inflation and has a vanishing maximum likelihood asymptotic choice. ACSS is essentially a parametric and asymptotically efficient test. Theoretically, it offers finite error power and is a valid choice for GOF testing, especially in scenarios with limited data.

This process involves minimizing the absolute correlation of the features, which is crucial for feature selection. However, it has been observed that minimizing the absolute correlation may not always lead to the most powerful knockoffs. Instead, minimizing the reconstructability of the features can significantly enhance the power of the knockoffs. This proposal introduces the use of Gaussian features, which are computationally efficient, robust, and powerful in minimizing the reconstructability of the knockoffs.

1. In the field of statistics, knockoff statistics have emerged as a powerful tool for feature selection in machine learning algorithms. By constructing synthetic knockoffs, we can effectively control the expected proportion of false discoveries. The key lies in minimizing the absolute correlation between the knockoff and the original feature, as this approach surprisingly lacks power. However, by minimizing the maximal correlation, we can create joint dependencies between the knockoff features and the machine learning algorithm, thereby reconstructing the effect of the response variable. This method significantly improves the power of generating knockoffs and minimizes reconstructability. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian feature knockoff that is computationally efficient, robust, and powerful. We demonstrate that the maximal reconstructability criterion (MRC) knockoff minimizes the notion of error, as evidenced by extensive Gaussian linear models. Furthermore, the MRC knockoff significantly outperforms the minimal absolute correlation (MAC) minimizing knockoff, and the MAC minimizing knockoff slightly outperforms the MRC knockoff. We implement the knockoff algorithm in a Python package, knockpy, to control the false discovery rate in multiple hypothesis testing with dependent tests. This package separately calibrates the dependent rejection thresholds, relaxing the tight threshold to target the exact false discovery rate control. We also propose a concrete algorithm based on the dependence-adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dbh) threshold, which uniformly dominates the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) threshold and the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) threshold with log correction in the worst case of dependence.

2. In survival analysis, the challenge of modeling right-censored lifetime data is unparalleled. Traditional univariate methods, such as the product limit and Kaplan-Meier, are limited in their ability to capture the joint probability density of survival times. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology that combines survival theory with sharp minimax adaptive nonparametric estimation techniques. By integrating the squared error criterion with the joint density estimation, we achieve a highly efficient approach to dealing with the impact of censoring. Our method is particularly effective in handling bivariate censoring scenarios, where the presence of censoring can significantly affect the estimation process. By studying the dependency complexity and noise in the data, we are able to accomplish the objective of demixing permutation noise, extending the concept of moment mixing to the noisy Mallow's model. This allows us to simulate a noiseless oracle, enabling accurate pairwise comparisons in a high-noise regime. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in characterizing the dependency complexity and noise in the data.

3. The selection of valid instrumental variables is crucial for treatment effect estimation when dealing with unobserved confounders. However, identifying valid instruments can be challenging, especially when multiple candidate instruments are considered, some of which may be invalid. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that reinforces the validity of instrumental variables, enabling nearly independent valid analysis. This is achieved by performing multiple instrumental analyses in a carefully ordered manner, ensuring orthogonality and balance between the factorial levels. We apply this strategy to a balanced block design, which is particularly useful in evaluating the causal effect of education on future earnings. By addressing the issue of treatment disruption due to world war II, we can construct a balanced block to estimate the causal effect of malaria on stunting in children in western Kenya. Furthermore, we consider nested instrumental variables, where multiple candidate instruments are nested within a balanced block. This approach is highly applicable in evaluating the impact of education on future earnings and the causal effect of malaria on child stunting.

4. The consistency and invariance properties of randomization tests, such as permutation tests and rotation tests, are well understood. However, the consistency property of invariance under randomization is much less understood. Assuming that the data is drawn from a signal-plus-noise model, we transform the data using permutations and rotations. By considering the compact topological structure of these transformations, we derive a generalized subadditivity property that is fundamental to the consistency of invariance. We apply this property to sparse high-dimensional vector detection problems and low-rank matrix detection problems with noise. By comparing the minimax lower bound, we show that randomization tests can detect the signal at the minimax rate. This result is perhaps surprising, as it demonstrates the power of randomization tests in dealing with high-dimensional data. Furthermore, we develop an iterative randomized Lindeberg bound that significantly improves the distributional approximation error bound, simultaneously achieving larger bootstrap sizes.

5. In the context of ranking players based on partial pairwise comparisons, the minimax rate of ranking is a critical concept. The Bradley-Terry-Luce model and the Kendall tau distance measure are commonly used to evaluate the performance of ranking algorithms. In this paper, we analyze the minimax rate of ranking based on the difference between the true rank vector and the estimated rank vector, counting the number of inversions. We show that the minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition from an exponential rate to a polynomial rate, depending on the magnitude of the signal-to-noise ratio. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is unique and has not been fully characterized in the literature. We propose a divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm that divides the players into groups based on their skill level and computes the local maximum likelihood estimate within each group. This approach is carefully designed to approximate independence between the groups, resulting in an optimal algorithm that achieves the minimax rate of ranking.

These knockoffs effectively manage false discovery rates by synthesizing data that acts as a control in the selection process. By minimizing the absolute correlation of the features, knockoffs provide a surprising level of control over the false discovery rate. However, when dealing with Gaussian linear models with correlated and exchangeable features, minimizing the Maximum Absolute Correlation (MAC) can lead to inefficient knockoffs. A more effective approach is to minimize the Minimum Reconstructability Criterion (MRC), as demonstrated in Gaussian feature knockoffs. This computationally efficient and robust method significantly outperforms MAC-minimizing knockoffs and offers a powerful tool for controlling false discovery rates in machine learning.
