[Thresholding covariance matrices offers a compelling approach to identifying sparse structures in high-dimensional data, with important implications for statistical inference and model selection. By targeting negative eigenvalues, this technique effectively fixes the drawback of traditional thresholding methods, which may not be suitable for positive definite matrices. The resulting sparse covariance matrices can be efficiently updated using alternating direction methods, which have been shown to converge under certain conditions in the optimization literature. This methodological development is particularly valuable for addressing the challenges of non-asymptotic theory, where competitive finite sample properties have been demonstrated in applications. The use of a reference prior, combined with a constant prior on the precision parameter, allows for a flexible embedding of the original continuous structure within a discrete space. This approach takes advantage of the structure of the problem and proposes a novel embedding that preserves the reference prior's theoretical properties. Four possible objectives are explored, each with its own embedding strategy, and the size of the hypergeometric parameters is recommended based on the binomial distribution, with the binomial beta binomial distribution being a particularly useful choice. In the context of portfolio selection, the introduction of a gross exposure constraint offers a novel approach to balancing risk and return, with theoretical justifications and empirical evidence provided in the literature. The application of this constraint to the problem of selecting a portfolio with optimal covariance can lead to significant improvements in performance, particularly when high-dimensional volatility matrices are considered. Furthermore, the theoretical error accumulation effects of vast covariance matrices are explored, leading to a more nuanced understanding of when and how to apply this approach effectively. The empirical results, as demonstrated in the Jagannathan-Ma (2000) example, suggest that allowing for short positions can enhance the tracking performance of portfolio selection algorithms. The utility of this approach is further highlighted through simulations that capture the recent trends in the market, providing accurate guidance for portfolio allocation in subsequent time periods. The use of high-frequency data enables a better adaptation to local volatilities and correlations, increasing the efficiency and stability of portfolio selection when dealing with a vast pool of assets. The concept of refresh time, as explored by Barndorff-Nielsen and Hansen (2009), is leveraged to propose a new perspective on portfolio selection that takes into account the time varying nature of volatility and correlation. A careful numerical comparison indicates that this approach performs significantly better than traditional methods, offering a promising avenue for the improvement of portfolio allocation strategies. ]

The use of nonparametric tests for multiple complex traits has shown significant advantages over parametric methods, particularly in terms of adjusting for effects and improving the power of empirical tests. The application of such tests in the study of genetic alcoholism has provided meaningful insights into the underlying genetic architecture, offering a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between genetic factors and alcoholism.
