1. The analysis of extreme stationary times reveals a primary clustering phenomenon, where the extremal index represents the expected cluster size. We delve into the comparison of sliding block and disjoint block extremal indices, detailing their asymptotic expansion, normality, and consistency. Through finite Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the superior performance of sliding block methods in capturing exceedance patterns in financial time series. Additionally, we explore the occurrence of random backward nested subspaces, leading to dimension reduction on manifolds and stratified spaces, where we formulate a backward nested family descriptor (BNFD) for strong consistency. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of local twice differentiable charts and asymptotic joint normality for BNFD, paving the way for intrinsic geodesic principal component analysis in Kendall shape spaces.

A detailed comparison of the sliding block extremal index with its competitors shows its superior performance in capturing exceedance events across various financial time sequences. The occurrence of random backward nested subspaces in higher dimensions suggests a reduction in manifold stratified spaces, where the asymptotic behavior is formulated using the backward nested family descriptor (BNFD), ensuring additional strong consistency. The existence of a local twice differentiable chart leads to asymptotic joint normality for the BNFD, further enhancing the understanding of principal nested geodesics and their spheres.
