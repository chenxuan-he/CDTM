Paragraph 1:
The development of a robust and efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm is a topic of great importance in the field of computational statistics. The focus has been on tuning the algorithm to ensure robustness while maintaining efficiency. It is often observed that sophisticated algorithms are sensitive to the choice of step size, which can lead to less robust behavior in the presence of heterogeneity. In studying the spectral gap of Markov chains, it is increasingly recognized that a poor choice of step size can significantly impact the performance of the algorithm. An MCMC algorithm inspired by the Barker accept-reject rule has been proposed, which improved the robustness properties and extended theoretical results on geometric ergodicity. A scaling dimension scheme combining robustness and efficiency has been introduced, which can significantly outperform state-of-the-art parallel tempering (PT) MCMC schemes in complex, high-dimensional probability models.

Paragraph 2:
From a state space perspective, PT MCMC schemes rely on a collection of interacting auxiliary chains targeting tempered targets to improve exploration. These highly parallel algorithms require careful tuning to identify the balance between robustness and efficiency. There is a formalized sharp divide between reversible and non-reversible PT schemes, with the latter theoretically and empirically dominating the reversible counterparts. The distinct scaling limits of non-reversible and reversible schemes are explored, with the former being piecewise deterministic Markov processes and the latter being diffusions. An annealing schedule is identified for a non-reversible PT iterative scheme, approximating a wide range of numerical applications and supporting theoretical methodological contributions.

Paragraph 3:
Methodologies for computing normalizing constants and integrating over likelihoods in Bayesian inference have seen significant development. While typical priors and likelihoods are often correctly specified, the choice of adaptive selection processes can lead to excess uncertainty. Moreover, the encoded priors are rarely grounded in the true underlying processes, making them prone to failure. A development inspired by free projection nonparametric methods offers a way to correct for main effects and effect modifications in generalized linear models. This approach advantages in capturing conditional associations and interactions between outcomes and covariates, offering a more robust and efficient way to estimate effects.

Paragraph 4:
Testing for conditional independence in functional random generalis requires the specification of a scalar response and a functional regressor. Idealised models often involve Gaussian processes, and the power of tests exceeds the conventional size when modeling is needed. The convenience of specifying functional regressors and testing hypotheses involving inner product residuals is highlighted, with calibrated error control for uniformly prediction errors. Ridge regression in a functional setting is considered, requiring a lower bound on the eigenvalue spacing of the covariance function of the regressor. The construction of confidence intervals for truncated functional linear tests is discussed, with an emphasis on edge functional graphical models.

Paragraph 5:
Bayesian non-linear diffusion processes in discrete time have been a challenging task, prompting the development of new algorithms within the computational community. Methodologies inspired by physics and computational chemistry have led to inference in posterior latent diffusion paths. By mapping noise onto diffusion paths consistently and implicitly, constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms can be embedded on manifolds, enabling computationally efficient sampling. This methodology is highly automated and requires minimal user intervention, applicable to a wide range of elliptic and hypo-elliptic systems with linear or non-linear operators. An iterative scheme exploiting Markovianity offers a linear complexity scale with respect to the resolution of the path discretisation. Reproducible Python code has been developed to demonstrate these methodologies in practice.

Paragraph 1:
The development of a robust and efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm is a significant challenge in computational statistics. The sensitivity of the choice of step size in MCMC algorithms often leads to less robust and less efficient results, especially in the presence of heterogeneity. In this study, we focus on tuning the robustness of sophisticated algorithms, showing that a careful selection of step sizes can significantly improve the robustness properties of MCMC algorithms. Our approach is inspired by the Barker accept-reject rule and demonstrates improved robustness properties. Extensive theoretical analysis dealing with the robustness tuning and geometric ergodicity of the algorithm is provided, combining robustness with efficiency. In particular, the gradient MCMC algorithm offers a significant advantage in terms of robustness, particularly beneficial in adaptive MCMC settings.

Paragraph 2:
We introduce a novel Parallel Tempering (PT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme that is designed to handle complex, high-dimensional probability distributions. This algorithm relies on a collection of interacting auxiliary chains that target tempered targets to improve exploration in the state space. From a parallel computing perspective, the algorithm offers a highly parallel solution, tuning the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm simultaneously. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the non-reversible PT scheme outperforms its reversible counterpart, identifying a distinct scaling limit for non-reversible PT schemes. The former is characterized by a piecewise deterministic Markov process, while the latter exploits a diffusion process. We identify an annealing schedule for the non-reversible PT iterative scheme, approximating a wide range of numerical applications. This methodology supports both theoretical and methodological contributions, applicable to computing normalizing constants and integrating over typical priors and likelihoods.

Paragraph 3:
In the context of generalized linear models, correctly specified priors are often unsatisfactory and lead to excessive uncertainty. Moreover, the chosen priors rarely represent the true ground truth, making the models prone to failure. Our inspired development of a free projection nonparametric definition addresses the main effect estimand and effect modification estimands, reducing the main effect and effect modification in generalized linear models. This approach correctly specifies the advantage of capturing conditional associations and interactions between the outcome and predictors, even when the models are misspecified. The resulting estimand is both efficient and lean, providing a basic efficient influence function for nonparametric inference. By invoking flexible and adaptive machine learning techniques, we test hypotheses conditionally independent functional random variables, idealizing scalar responses and functional regressors. Additionally, the Gaussian power test exceeds its size when modeling is needed, arguing for the convenience of specifying regression tests involving inner product residuals and calibrating errors.

Paragraph 4:
The construction of confidence intervals for functional linear models involves truncated functional linear tests and edge functional graphical models. Bayesian non-linear diffusion models in discrete time present a challenging task, prompting the development of new algorithms mainly within the computational community. Borrowing ideas from physics and computational chemistry, we infer posterior latent diffusion paths by mapping noise onto diffusion paths consistently. This approach embeds the constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm within a manifold, allowing computationally efficient discrete diffusion. The methodology is highly automated, requiring minimal user intervention, and can be applied to a range of elliptic and hypo-elliptic systems with linear or non-linear operators. Exploiting Markovianity, the complexity scales linearly with respect to resolution and path discretization. Python code is provided for reproducing the generalised Bayesian update, demonstrating the robustness of the method.

Paragraph 5:
In the context of generalized Bayesian updating, the prior belief loss is weighted more heavily than the likelihood, conferring robustness to the model specification. The application of Stein's discrepancy loss in the presence of intractable normalization constants allows for the evaluation of the likelihood and the production of a generalised posterior that is closed and accessible. Theoretical results highlight the consistency and asymptotic normality of the generalised posterior, emphasizing the impact of the choice of Stein discrepancy on numerical experiments. A range of intractable applications in the kernel exponential family and non-Gaussian graphical models benefit from this approach. High-dimensional changepoint detection in Gaussian streams, where variables undergo simultaneous changes, is addressed using a likelihood ratio test and a coordinate aggregating algorithm. The proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of storage requirements and worst-case computational complexity, offering a faster and more patient algorithm with a guaranteed nominal level guarantee and response delay sparsity.
