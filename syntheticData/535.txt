1. In the realm of stochastic differential equations, the quest for identifying periodic solutions of multidimensional systems via penalized least squares methods has been a subject of intense study. The convergence rates of these solutions, in the presence of a Lipshitz vector field and driven by a d-dimensional Brownian motion, have been thoroughly investigated. The posterior rates, derived from a high-dimensional Gaussian product prior, have led to the deduction of a contraction rate for the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator. This, in turn, has implications for the log-factor loss and the sup-norm loss in nonparametric estimation. The semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem has been extended to include posterior deductions and functional Central Limit Theorems, suggesting an asymptotically theoretic view of parametric and nonparametric likelihood ratios. The Wilk's theorem has been shown to be asymptotically free, restoring the Wilk phenomenon in a step-semiparametric framework, enhancing the main insights of empirical likelihood methods.

2. The application of conditional particle filters (CPFs) in hidden Markov models has seen significant advancements, with empirical evidence suggesting variant CPFs outperform traditional backward sampling methods. The CBPF algorithm maintains stability properties in a particle-independent time horizon, coupling the CPF with conditional backward sampling to yield a particle filter that remains effective over time. This development has provided theoretical tools that are both practical and unbiased for smoothing expectations in recent advancements such as those by Jacob Lindsten and Per Schon.

3. Weighted particle systems have gained popularity in the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) community, with the generation of resampled particles proportional to their probability weights. This approach covers a broad range of applications within the SMC framework, where the genealogical tree embedded in the system identifies time scaling and convergence properties. The infinite system size limit, in the sense of finite-dimensional tractability, predicts the shape and size of the SMC genealogy, characterizing the limiting variance and tree height.

4. Bayesian credible interval construction has seen significant progress, with adaptive nonparametric methods overcoming the frequentist coverage property. The adaptive Honest Confidence Sieve Prior offers a polished tail and hierarchical empirical Bayesian approach, providing a characterized size for abstract nonparametric regression densities. This construction extends to exponential family priors and histogram priors, offering a near-minimax adaptive pseudometric for nonparametric classification problems.

5. Adaptive MCMC algorithms have been refined, with the development of auxiliary adaptive MCMC methods that facilitate the exploration of multi-modal targets. Techniques such as splitting tasks and mode sampling have been merged to create an order-adaptive scheme that aids in local jump moves and mode updates. The CBPF algorithm, in particular, has shown good stability properties in terms of particle coupling and strong mixing, providing theoretical tools that are practical and beneficial for a wide range of applications.

Paragraph 2:
Determining the solutions of periodic Lipschitz vector fields through multi-dimensional stochastic differential equations, involving dimensional Brownian motion, results in a convergence rate that is penalized by the least squares method. This leads to an equal maximum a posteriori map, where high-dimensional Gaussian product priors are deduced, resulting in a contraction rate for the posterior. The log-factor loss in dimensions leads to a maximum norm loss in the nonparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem, which is proven to be asymptotically theoretic. From a parametric perspective, nonparametric methods and empirical likelihood ratios satisfy the nonparametric Wilk theorem, while semiparametric methods involve a step-plug empirical likelihood ratio that is asymptotically free. This approach contains quantities that break and restore the Wilk phenomenon, offering insights into the step-semiparametric empirical likelihood method. The main insight here is the moment equation, which influences the plug-in moment and chi-squared limiting degrees of freedom, resulting in efficient undersmoothing that is less sensitive. This is particularly appealing in high-dimensional applications, offering excellent finite relative competing methods. Asymptotic expansions elucidate the dominant contributions to the excess risk, which arise from the tail margins and the finite rho-th moments of the rho regularity of the local choice, yielding a rate of convergence for the excess risk size. The nearest neighbour classifier, in theory, achieves a rate of convergence for rho-finite moments when the marginal feature density is finite. This motivates the use of the nearest neighbour classifier in semi-supervised learning, where unlabelled data is used to improve classification density, resulting in a worse rate that is complemented by a minimax lower bound, revealing the local semi-supervised nearest neighbour classifier's ability to attain the minimax rate for the excess risk.

Paragraph 3:
In the realm of conditional particle filtering, the CBPF algorithm is a promising tool for handling hidden Markov models, with empirical evidence supporting its efficacy. By employing backward sampling, the CBPF performs long-term predictions with strong stability properties, ensuring that the particle independence over time holds. The CBPF's coupled conditional backward sampling particle filter, or CCBPF, offers a good balance between stability and the ability to handle high-dimensional data, maintaining linear time complexity with respect to the time horizon and demonstrating strong mixing properties. Recent developments in the field, such as those by Jacob Lindsten and Schon, have enabled the construction of asymptotically exact confidence intervals, facilitating straightforward parallelisation and improving the practical unbiased smoothing expectations. The adaptive MCMC algorithm specialises in handling complex, high-dimensional state spaces, providing theoretical guarantees and significant gains in computational complexity for a variety of applications.

Paragraph 4:
Semiparametric Bayesian methods address the issue of missing binary outcomes by modelling the propensity scores, correcting for confounding through the use of Gaussian processes. Efficiently weaker theories prefer the Dirichlet process over the Gaussian process, as it offers a Bayesian bootstrap that is more suitable for nonparametrically modelling the density. This approach ensures that the semiparametric Bernstein-von Mises theorem is satisfied, providing a smoothness property that is dependent on the propensity score, and leading to efficient and theoretically preferable methods in the field.

Paragraph 5:
Sequential Monte Carlo particle techniques offer an approximation to high-dimensional probability distributions, with the normalising constant being a crucial factor. These methods have found numerous applications in nonlinear, non-Gaussian state spaces, with the stability of the algorithm being a significant advantage. The insights gained from the fluctuations stability methodology have provided valuable contributions to the state of the art in computational complexity, allowing for a variety of applications to benefit from these advanced techniques.

Paragraph 6:
Parametric and nonparametric methods, as well as empirical likelihood ratios, all contribute to the satisfaction of the nonparametric Wilk theorem in Bayesian inference. Semiparametric methods, on the other hand, rely on a step-plug empirical likelihood ratio that is asymptotically free, containing quantities that can break and restore the Wilk phenomenon. The step-semiparametric empirical likelihood method offers the main insight, which is the moment equation and its influence on the plug-in moment and chi-squared limiting degrees of freedom. This results in efficient undersmoothing that is less sensitive and is particularly appealing in high-dimensional applications, providing excellent finite relative competing methods. Asymptotic expansions help elucidate the dominant contributions to the excess risk, which arise from the tail margins and the finite rho-th moments of the rho regularity of the local choice, yielding a rate of convergence for the excess risk size.
