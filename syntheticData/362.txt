Moreover, this approach ensures consistency with the weakly bounded epsilon moments, resulting in an element-wise convergence rate that exhibits superior performance compared to epsilon-based methods.

4. The intricate and plausibly generated structures present in high-dimensional data rely on the leptokurtic properties of their constituent components. This allows for the creation of a precise covariance matrix, known as the summary structure matrix, which summarizes the data's complex relationships. The success of this matrix is attributed to the assumption of sub-Gaussianity, which ensures a convergence rate that is both minimax and consistent with the weakly bounded epsilon moments. As a result, this approach yields an element-wise convergence rate that outperforms traditional epsilon-based methods.

5. High-dimensional data analysis frequently involves complex structures that are better described by a covariance matrix exhibiting leptokurtic characteristics. This matrix, known as the summary structure matrix, is critical in capturing the data's intricate relationships. The assumption of sub-Gaussianity is fundamental in guaranteeing a convergence rate that is both minimax and consistent with the weakly bounded epsilon moments. This approach also leads to an element-wise convergence rate that significantly outperforms conventional epsilon-based methods.
