Quantile regression has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing competing risks, addressing the issue of scarce continuous marks and the induction of failure in competing risks. The cause of failure is replaced by an uncensored failure time continuous mark, considering factors such as genetic distance and viral infection. Vaccine constructs are marked, and quantile regression leverages the strengths of neighboring marks to develop smoothed equations. Competing risks with discrete causes present asymptotic properties across mark quantile continuum marks. The vaccine efficacy is evaluated in conducted trials, applying finite hypothesis testing for HIV vaccine efficacy. Credible regions are established through matching prior levels and intervals, ensuring confidence in the existence of matching priors, maintaining the primary topology of the credible region. The existence of a matching prior family credible region is formally compact, and the Wasserstein distance allows for a prior light approach. Typical family credible intervals and credible balls for the highest posterior density region of quantiles, etc., do not meet topological requirements, but an approximate posterior credible ball satisfies topology. This leads to a matching prior for evaluation, utilizing a numerical scheme computing approximately, discretization, and iteration to prove the main theorem. The tool extends nonstandard methods with the Wasserstein distance, remaining linearized and independent for maximum rank correlation single index unlike maximum rank correlation rank closed expressions, appealing theory, and computation robustness. Outlier responses are constructed with knowledge of error links, mild consistency, and asymptotically normal predictors that satisfy linearity expectations, employing imputation rules and random weighting resampling. The algorithm effectively accommodates censored data and extended high-dimensional combined penalties, demonstrating extensive strong evidence for practical applications, such as the Beijing PM debiased stochastic gradient descent algorithm. This high-dimensional combination of debiasing techniques constructs confidence intervals efficiently, appealing aspects of the algorithm that reduce time complexity in updates, currently alongside previous methods, reducing space complexity with asymptotic normality, mild sparsity levels, and numerical experiments achieving nominal coverage probabilities in high-dimensional spaces].
