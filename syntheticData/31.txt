This innovative method significantly outperforms traditional control variates and provides higher precision with fewer computational demands. The integration of non-linear ordinary differential equations in a hierarchical framework highlights the limitations of covariance structures in accounting for serial dependence and stationarity. Recent studies have explored quantile spectral methods, which surpass covariance structures by relaxing the stationarity assumption, enabling the analysis of time-varying copula spectra. This approach introduces locally stationary processes that accommodate time-varying dependencies, addressing the challenges of non-linear processes and the limitations of the central limit theorem.

5. Nonparametric techniques have extended control variate methods, leveraging gradient sampling to achieve substantial variance reduction. This approach requires a moderate sampling density, leading to normalized contributions that provide valuable insights. By utilizing the Stein identity, random sampling is replaced with a deterministic approximation, improving the gradient space's convergence rate.
