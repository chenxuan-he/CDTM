1. The exploration of generalized ordinary differential equations (GODEs) for the purpose of robust computation in the presence of measurement errors is the focus of this study. By rigorously analyzing the asymptotic properties, the study extends the smoothing algorithm to enhance the accuracy of numerical solutions for ODEs. Furthermore, the application of GODEs in influenza viral dynamics and directional data in scientific fields such as oceanography, meteorology, and biology is discussed. The integration of a Gaussian spatial process into the modeling framework enables the capturing of structured spatial dependencies and the direction of spatial locations. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications like modeling wave direction in the Adriatic Sea, Italy.

2. The coexistence of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the human genome significantly contributes to phenotypic variations. Current SNP genotyping technologies struggle to capture both CNVs and SNPs simultaneously. This study presents a fluorescent intensity measurement approach to calling CNVs, addressing downstream association limitations. It also emphasizes the importance of differential measurement error control and integrating CNV and SNP total copy information in a single-step analysis. The application of maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithms in this context offers advantages in accounting for sampling and measurement errors, as demonstrated in the context of genome-wide association studies for schizophrenia.

3. The application of the bootstrap method in testing the hypothesis on the rank of a matrix is discussed, highlighting its limitations when dealing with submanifolds. The study introduces a non-asymptotic quantile test that sheds light on the accuracy of the bootstrap in traditional asymptotic comparisons. The extended test evaluates the membership of a matrix in a submanifold of Euclidean space, offering an easier computational approach compared to the bootstrap. This is exemplified through a practical application involving the modeling of wave direction along the coast of the Adriatic Sea in Italy, where directional changes over time necessitate spatio-temporal extensions.

4. The challenge of non-randomized treatment assignment in clustered randomized trials is addressed in this study. It discusses the increased sampling variability and reduced efficiency due to clustered randomization and the need to account for non-random selection bias. The study proposes a technique to examine the sensitivity of conclusions to such biases and exploits convexity in applications, such as assessing the impact of flooding in villages in Bangladesh. By incorporating asymptotic sensitivity inequalities, the study provides insights into the dominance of certain effects over others in clustered treatment assignments.

5. The study investigates the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation by mapping their positions at single-base pair resolution. It employs chemical mapping techniques and signal deconvolution to quantify the effectiveness of nucleosome positioning. The research also discusses the challenges of modeling the mixture of cells with dynamic nucleosome positioning and presents a maximum likelihood deconvolution method to tackle these issues. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the application of chemical mapping techniques to study nucleosome positioning signals.

1. Generalized ordinary differential equations (GODEs) are investigated as a robust computing algorithm for solving ODEs with time-varying likelihoods, considering measurement errors. The extended smoothing ESB algorithm shows superior accuracy in modeling influenza viral dynamics. Additionally, the ODE is extended to include a directional component, naturally arising in scientific fields such as oceanography for wave direction, meteorology for wind direction, and biology for animal movement direction. This contribution aims to fully capture structured spatial dependence in modeling directional spatial locations by building a projected Gaussian spatial process, which is induced by an in-line bivariate Gaussian spatial process. The projected GP is suitable for spatial interpolation, and a comparison using simulated data demonstrates the proof of concept application in ARIS modeling of wave direction along the Adriatic Sea coast in Italy.

2. Copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) coexist throughout the human genome and jointly contribute to phenotypic variation. Current SNP genotyping technology can capture CNVs and SNPs simultaneously using fluorescent intensity measurements. However, calling CNVs based on intensity measurements has limitations and can lead to false positives. By integrating CNV and SNP total copy information in a single step, the differential measurement error can be properly accounted for, and a robust association test can be constructed. An advantage is demonstrated in a realistic application using genome-wide association studies for schizophrenia. The extension to next-generation sequencing tests the matrix rank hypothesis, which is noted for its squared distance to a submanifold and convergence to a weighted chi-squared distribution. The bootstrap law fails to reproduce the behavior, and a non-asymptotic quantile test is employed to assess rank consistency and shed light on the accuracy of the bootstrap compared to traditional asymptotic tests.

3. In supersaturated screening experiments, investigators wish to focus on fewer factors. The traditional approach of using a box suggested by Booth and Cox is not always available, and the efficiency is based on the average square diagonal entry of the matrix, ignoring the intercept and main effects. To minimize bias and identify nearly orthogonal factors, a balanced design is essential. The construction criterion from the traditional optimality theory minimizes bias, and a supersaturated design constructed with chemical balance weighing, as suggested by Galil, Kiefer, and Cheng, can yield precise intercepts and efficient main effects. The theoretical properties recommend using a supersaturated design in screening experiments, especially when the factors are in a specific range and the prior variance is sufficient.

4. In causal observational studies, researchers often rely on the notion of propensity scores to adjust for confounding factors in treatment comparisons. With the era of big data, researchers increasingly rely on complex digital collections, frequently confronting decisions regarding high-dimensional data. Bayesian selection and averaging are employed to select relevant candidate treatments, with weights reflecting the support for the necessary feature. Ultimately, the effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for brain tumors in Medicare beneficiaries is evaluated. This approach acknowledges the uncertainty in selection and aims to arrive at a single treatment by acknowledging the uncertainty in selection. The Bayesian selection averaging selects relevant candidate treatments, with weights reflecting the driven support.

5. Random fields are employed as predictors in expensive experiments, but traditional development fails due to the computational burden. Approximative predictors have been the focus to resolve this issue. A solution mechanism is employed to quickly compute predictors with reasonable accuracy. Research has demonstrated that a subset of predictors can generate predictors asymptotically efficiently. An empirical comparison using space-filling designs verifies competitive prediction accuracy. Additionally, the research has shown that a subset of predictors can generate predictors asymptotically efficiently, and an empirical comparison using space-filling designs verifies competitive prediction accuracy.

1. The investigation of generalized ordinary differential equations (GODE) has led to the development of robust computing algorithms with rigorous asymptotic properties. By considering measurement and numerical errors, these algorithms offer superior accuracy in solving ODEs, particularly in applications like influenza viral dynamics. An extended smoothing ESB (Directional Smoothing Estimation) method naturally arises in scientific fields such as oceanography for wave direction, meteorology for wind direction, and biology for animal movement direction. This contribution aims to fully capture structured spatial dependence in modeling directional spatial locations, building on the projected Gaussian spatial process induced by an inline bivariate Gaussian spatial process.

2. The coexistence of copy number variations (CNVs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the human genome significantly contributes to phenotypic variation. Current SNP genotyping technology captures CNVs and SNPs simultaneously using fluorescent intensity measurements for calling CNVs. However, the downstream association analysis is limited by the calling of CNV intensity measurements, leading to false positives due to differential measurement error. An integrated CNV and SNP total copy approach, combined with a single-step association analysis, allows for the proper accounting of differential measurement error and sampling uncertainty. The asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood EM algorithm are utilized to implement this advantage, as demonstrated in realistic genome-wide association studies for schizophrenia.

3. The rank hypothesis test for matrices has noted that the squared distance to a submanifold converges to a weighted chi-squared distribution. The bootstrap law fails to reproduce this behavior, leading to consequences in traditional asymptotic comparison tests. To address this, a non-asymptotic quantile test for rank consistency has been proposed, shedding light on the accuracy of the bootstrap compared to traditional asymptotic methods. This extended test determines whether a matrix belongs to a submanifold in Euclidean space and is easily computed within a family of tests, offering a mild computational burden.

4. In supersaturated screening experiments, investigators often wish to focus on fewer factors to reduce the experiment's complexity. Traditional methods may be unavailable or impractical, leading to suggestions for supersaturated designs and the use of efficiency criteria, such as the average of the square of the diagonal entries of the matrix, while ignoring the intercept and main effects. Every factor must be orthogonal to the intercept to balance the design and minimize bias in identifying nearly orthogonal factors. This approach enjoys the desirable property of efficient factor balance and essentially optimizes the construction criterion from a traditional optimality theory perspective.

5. The application of random fields as predictors in expensive experiments has been limited by the computational burden associated with high-dimensional inputs. Previous research has focused on developing approximative predictors to resolve this issue. A novel solution mechanism employs predictors that can be quickly computed with reasonable accuracy, offering a significant computational saving. Research has demonstrated that a subset of predictors can generate asymptotically efficient predictions, with empirical comparisons verifying competitive prediction accuracy. This fast computation predictor algorithm has the potential to greatly expand the practical applicability of random field modeling in various scientific fields.

1. The investigation of generalized ordinary differential equations (GODEs) for discrete systems has led to the development of robust computing algorithms with rigorous asymptotic properties. These algorithms are particularly useful in applications such as influenza viral dynamics, where the need for high accuracy is paramount. By extending smoothing techniques and incorporating directional information, GODEs can naturally arise in various scientific fields, including oceanography for wave direction analysis, meteorology for wind direction modeling, and biology for animal movement studies. The contribution of GODEs lies in their ability to fully capture structured spatial dependencies, enabling the construction of projected Gaussian spatial processes for modeling directional spatial data. This has significant implications for fields like the modeling of wave direction along the Adriatic Sea coast in Italy, where the directional data varies across time and requires spatio-temporal extensions of the modeling framework.

2. Advances in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technology have allowed for the simultaneous capture of copy number variations (CNVs) and SNPs, which coexist throughout the human genome and jointly contribute to phenotypic variation. Current SNP genotyping technologies, based on fluorescent intensity measurements, have limitations in calling CNVs accurately due to measurement errors and differential measurement error control. However, by integrating CNV and SNP information in a single-step approach, and properly accounting for sampling and measurement errors in the likelihood construction, the maximum likelihood estimation method can be implemented advantageously. This has been demonstrated in realistic applications, such as genome-wide association studies for schizophrenia, where the extension to next-generation sequencing tests has been particularly impactful.

3. In the context of analyzing randomized trials with suspected treatment effects that differ across predefined subpopulations, a formalized multiple testing framework is computationally infeasible. To address this, a transformation technique involving sparse linear programming can be used to solve a variety of multiple testing problems efficiently. This approach has been successfully applied in HIV treatment randomized trials, where the goal is to learn the subpopulation benefit from an experimental treatment while providing strong control over the family-wise error rate. By transforming the original multiple tests into a single sparse linear program, the technique offers an advanced optimization solution that satisfies minimax Bayes optimality criteria and strikes a balance between the power to detect effects overall and within subpopulations.

4. The application of regularization techniques in machine learning, such as the Lasso, Fused Lasso, and Generalized Penalized Regression, is crucial for preventing overfitting and guiding the solution towards a prior that encourages sparsity. These methods, following recent ideas in exact path solvers for ordinary differential equations (EPSODEs), can efficiently handle generalized penalties and complex regularization with inequality constraints. This has proven particularly useful in shape-restricted regression, nonparametric density estimation, and equality-constrained regularization problems. The EPSODE algorithm showcases its potential in these applications by providing nonasymptotic error bounds and equality-constrained regularization solutions, coupled with model selection techniques like AIC, BIC, and cross-validation for convenient tuning in the parameter space.

5. The analysis of gene regulation networks (GRNs) as high-dimensional complex systems often involves the use of mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Traditional linear ODEs have limitations in capturing nonlinear regulation effects, but sparse additive ODEs (SA-ODEs) coupled with adaptive techniques like the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) can flexibly handle nonlinear dynamics. The asymptotic properties of these approaches have been validated through applications in identifying nonlinear dynamic GRNs, particularly in cell activation studies where their usefulness has been demonstrated. This advancement in modeling GRNs has significant implications for understanding the complex dynamics underlying gene expression and cellular behavior.
