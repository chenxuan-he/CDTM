The optimality criteria for such a regression are based on the exponential family and constructed efficiency. The theoretic optimality propertyScore-based predictive likelihood and device updating provide valuable time-varying information in a univariate driven continuous response model. The focus is on updating the score in a way that consistently reduces the local Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true conditional density and the implied conditional density.

3. A score-driven generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model is proposed, which updates the score in a manner that always reduces the local Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and implied conditional densities. This approach holds regardless of the severity of the measurement error specification. The main contribution of this work is an update score that consistently reduces the global Kullback-Leibler divergence, empirically relevant across a substantial range of update squared lagged contamination ratios.

4. Outliers are an inevitable part of data, and robust methods are needed to handle them. A robust basic scoring rule is proposed, which assesses the quality of probabilistic forecasts by comparing the contamination ratio to a specified threshold. The scoring rule effectively detects outliers and sets a threshold for the contamination ratio, ensuring that the presence of outliers does not significantly affect the robust regression analysis.

5. In the context of regression with categorical responses, a unified specification is developed that decomposes the link function into an inverse continuous cumulative ratio probability distribution. This defines a family of reference nominal responses that are comparable to adjacent cumulative sequential ordinal responses. The equivalence of cumulative sequential invariance under permutation and category reversibility is established, distinguishing adjacent cumulative sequential families from reference tested benchmarks.
