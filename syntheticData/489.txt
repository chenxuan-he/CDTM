This approach allows for the quantification of dependence structures in a principled manner, utilizing the Wasserstein metric to define distances in a space of probability closeness.

Paragraph 4:
The independence test, a fundamental tool in statistical analysis, has been advanced by incorporating additional smoothness constraints. This leads to the permutation test, which offers a valid and uniformly consistent test for independence when additional assumptions are imposed. These tests are crucial in fields where exchangeability is a sensible implication, ensuring that cluster sizes do not grow linearly with data size.

Paragraph 5:
Delayed acceptance algorithms, such as the Metropolis-Hastings method, have revolutionized the computation of posterior distributions. By incorporating deterministic approximations, these algorithms reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. This has opened up new avenues in high-dimensional target spaces, where traditional methods might be computationally intractable.
