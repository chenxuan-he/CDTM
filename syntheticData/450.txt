The theoretical utility of the proposal is confirmed through numerical experiments, demonstrating the practical utility of CQR in high-dimensional regression problems.

4. The normal hierarchical model (NHM) has played a critical role in the theory of random effects over the last decade. It simultaneously improves the shrinkage factor and protects against empirical best linear unbiased predictor (EBLUP) bias. The NHM addresses the issue of overshrinkage and avoids complex bias corrections, generating strictly positive order unbiased estimates of the mean square error (MSE). The integrated Bayes risk is considered, along with the Taylor single parametric bootstrap, to achieve multiple desirable properties of the EBLUP. The NHM holds promise in providing a good random effects predictor, and its methodology is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations.

5. The detection of sparse signals in the context of beta potentially sparse random graphs is explored, highlighting the interesting interplay between graph sparsity and signal sparsity. The regime of moderately dense signals shows that the detection threshold is mirrored by the independent Gaussian sequence, regardless of graph sparsity. However, in the case of extremely sparse graphs, the test becomes asymptotically powerless, irrespective of signal strength. Conversely, for denser graphs, a sharp detection threshold is observed, matching the constant phase transition mentioned earlier. This sharp threshold is a crucial ingredient in the higher criticism test, which has been theoretically verified and numerically tested for its ability to detect sparse signals efficiently.

1. "The asymptotic efficiency of the generalized likelihood ratio test in the presence of Cox's deviation and error probability is investigated. The Chernoff bound is used to separate the parametric family of hypotheses, and the proc TH in Berkeley's symposium on mathematics, statistics, and probability is used to analyze the significance level and the maximal error probability. The decay of the error probability is shown to be exponentially fast, with an analytic rate given by the Chernoff index. The relative efficiency and preference of the hypotheses are discussed, along with the approximate error probability for families that are completely separated. The implications of the selection of the Gaussian stochastic process in the context of emulation and computer approximation are also examined."

2. "The main focus of the GASP is the generalized maximum likelihood, mostly involving the posterior mode in the full Bayesian computer emulation, which can be prohibitively expensive. The posterior mode arises from the objective prior reference, and the prior is an isotropic covariance with separability in the input. The construction of the Latin hypercube and the anisotropic correlation is written as a product of the isotropic correlation, with a range of roughness properties in the objective prior. The marginal likelihood of the GASP and the propriety of the posterior are also discussed, along with the main focus on the parameterization and the robustness of the GASP parameterization, which is clearly avoided in applicable frequently covariance power exponential Matern rational quadratic spherical covariance."

3. "The theoretical and numerical evidence concerning the central random matrix theory and the understanding of the eigenvalues in the spiked random matrix are discussed. Johnstone's prominent eigenvector spike in the planted random matrix is natural for the principal component analysis (PCA) throughout science. Baik, Ben Arous, and Peché showed that the spiked Wishart ensemble exhibits a sharp phase transition asymptotically as the spike strength reaches a critical threshold, which can detect the presence of the spike in the top eigenvalue. The threshold in the top eigenvalue is the basis for understanding the PCA and detecting the low-rank signal in the presence of noise. The structural spike is necessarily contained in the spectrum, and the limit test for the presence of the spike is a non-spectral test using the leverage and the notion of contiguity in the Gaussian Wigner ensemble."

4. "The PCA achieves the detection threshold in the natural prior spike in the non-Gaussian Wigner ensemble, and a more efficient variant of the PCA achieves the threshold in the natural prior. The pre-transforming matrix entry in the Gaussian Wishart ensemble PCA threshold is positive for the spike, while the natural prior is always negative for the spike. The tuning of the regularization lasso threshold and the approximate message passing (AMP) considering the matrix noise as zero in the Gaussian-driven regularization lasso threshold is consistent and converges asymptotically in probability. The ambient dimension of the sparse vector grows to infinity, and the convergence is a byproduct that will shed light on the asymptotic properties of the solution paths of the lasso and AMP."

5. "The censored quantile regression (CQR) has emerged as a regression tool for survival data. The CQR is characterized by a stochastic integral equation that is analyzed sequentially across quantile levels. The CQR in high-dimensional regression is analyzed at a continuum of quantile levels with a step penalization to accommodate the stochastic integral equation. The challenge of the recursive nature and the uniform convergence rate property for weak convergence and selection is addressed. The numerical confirmation of the theoretical and practical utility of the proposal is conducted."

1. Asymptotic Efficiency and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test in Cox Regression
The generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is a powerful statistical tool for hypothesis testing in parametric models. In the context of Cox regression, the GLRT has been shown to possess asymptotic efficiency, meaning its error probability decays exponentially fast to zero. The Chernoff bound offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the rate of this decay. Separate parametric families can be compared using the GLRT, which maintains significance levels and maximal error probabilities under control. This test is particularly useful in the analysis of survival data, where it can detect deviations from the null hypothesis at a specified significance level.

1. The asymptotic efficiency of the generalized likelihood ratio test for the Cox model is analyzed with respect to the deviation of the error probability. It is shown that the Chernoff bound separates the parametric families of hypotheses, leading to a significant decrease in the maximal error probability as the significance level decreases. The decay is exponentially fast, as indicated by the analytic rate Chernoff index. This is discussed in the context of the preference of hypotheses and the approximate error probability for families that are completely separated.

2. In the context of Gaussian stochastic processes, the generalized approximate sub-sampling procedure (GASP) is utilized for emulation and approximation in computer experiments. The focus is on the posterior mode estimation in the full Bayesian computer emulation, which is often prohibitively expensive. The objective is to avoid the need for an objective prior reference and to construct an anisotropic correlation matrix using a Latin hypercube design. The range roughness property is a key consideration in this approach.

3. The recovery of a piecewise constant signal on graphs is investigated by minimizing an edge-penalized objective. The exact minimization of this objective is computationally intractable, but a polynomial-time alpha-expansion algorithm is proposed to compute an approximate minimizer. The algorithm achieves a minimax rate guarantee under the assumption of an average vertex degree and is particularly effective for spatially inhomogeneous graphs. The theoretical risk guarantee is always achieved by minimizing the total variation relaxation, and empirical results show high accuracy even in the presence of high signal noise.

4. The stochastic block model (SBM) is a popular tool for community detection in networks, and its maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) involves a computationally infeasible optimization problem. A semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the MLE is introduced, which reveals connections to sparse PCA and provides a tighter SDP relaxation than previous methods. The theoretical guarantees for exact recovery of the true community structure are extended to a wider class of SBMs, including those with strong assortativity. The SDP relaxation is shown to be insensitive to the minimum degree in the sparse regime and enjoys competitive performance in synthetic network experiments.

5. A unifying view of multiway Bayesian hypothesis testing is presented, focusing on the loss function for multiclass classification and multidistribution divergence. The equivalence of objectives is elaborated upon, extending the binary outcome space to a generalization for multiple outcomes. The major application is in multiclass classification, where the discriminant gamma must be inferred to make predictions. The loss function is optimized to yield a discriminant quantizer, which complements and extends earlier work on multiclass classification calibration and comparison of convex loss functions.
