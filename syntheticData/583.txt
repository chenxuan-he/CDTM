The changing nature of time necessitates the successful implementation of a kernel normalized least squares (KNL) approach, which outperforms previous kernel-based methods such as the quasi-maximum likelihood (KQML) kernel. The KNL method avoids the space restrictions imposed by the KQML kernel and offers theoretical evidence of rate convergence. Furthermore, the KNL kernel is computationally efficient, making it suitable for intensive predictions and cross-validation procedures. The selection of the bandwidth for the KNL kernel is facilitated by a residual bootstrap scheme, which also applies to the bootstrap TVArch process. This approach allows for the construction of bootstrap pointwise confidence intervals and ensures that the true TVArch asymptotically coincides with the bootstrapped results. The KNL method provides an accurate fit and reliable forecasts for a variety of currency exchange and stock index datasets.
