In the realm of empirical Bayes methods, the investigation of prior mixtures involving heavy-tailed densities, such as the gamma distribution, has gained attention. The choice of mixing weights is based on the marginal maximum likelihood estimate. This approach allows for the adaptation of sparse and dense sequences, resulting in a posterior median that follows a random thresholding rule.
