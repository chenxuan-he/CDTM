4. The application of change hypothesis tests in the context of non-stationarity is explored. The test formulation involves parallel processes and considers the cumulative sum principle for asymptotic weak convergence of sequential empirical processes. The test methodology requires the construction of confidence intervals for the difference in change hypotheses and examines the validity of the causal relationship across intervention scenarios. The structural equation approach is detailed, focusing on the identification of causal predictors and the robustness property in the presence of misspecification.

5. The analysis of wide multivariate volatility models employs a simpler and more numerically efficient approach based on univariate generalized auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) equations. The step correlation matrix and dynamic conditional correlation tests are used to impose restrictions on the multivariate GARCH specification. The consistency of the conditional correlation and the asymptotic normality of the estimator play a crucial role in the application of these models in financial analysis. The use of markov chain monte carlo algorithms allows for the accurate simulation of diffusion bridges, which are fundamental in likelihood and Bayesian stochastic differential equation applications. The long-interval computational complexity is reduced through linear length intervals, making the approach useful and applicable in various applications, including Bayesian multivariate hyperbolic diffusion models.
