2. In the realm of microarray data analysis, the False Discovery Proportion (FDP) is a critical metric that measures the proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses. An intriguing property of the Sample Average Method (SAM) is that it provides an upper confidence bound for the FDP, ensuring that the true FDP is not greater than a specified confidence level. Remarkably, this method may actually underestimate the true FDP probability. Furthermore, a closed-form test based on the Sorted Sampling algorithm is introduced, which decreases the upper bound on the confidence level while maintaining the exactness of the test.

3. Expectation Propagation (EP) is a successful algorithm for approximating complex Gaussian approximations in Bayesian inference. Despite its widespread use and theoretical guarantees, the Gaussian EP is poorly understood. In this work, we analyze a variant of the EP algorithm, the Averaged EP, which operates in a smaller space and converges to an almost Gaussian limit as the iteration number increases. This new insight into the dynamic behavior of EP provides asymptotically exact results and offers a deeper understanding of its convergence properties.

4. The availability of causal relationships is often taken for granted in scientific research. However, the presence of unmeasured confounding factors can lead to invalid causal inferences. To address this issue, we employ an auxiliary variable method to explain and understand the missing patterns in the data, evaluating the causal relationships in a controlled manner. The method is particularly useful when the availability of the causal factors is uncertain, and it can be easily validated and checked for construct validity.

5. The Wasserstein distance is an attractive tool for measuring the difference between probability distributions, but its application is often hindered by the lack of a finite distributional limit. We overcome this obstacle by supporting the finitely asymptotic empirical Wasserstein distance with a linear program, facilitating confidence interval (CI) construction. The generality of this proof, along with the directional Hadamard differentiability, fails to provide a bootstrap utility for testing multivariate random continuity. However, the proposed method offers a distributional test that can determine whether jointly mutually independent random variables are possibly multivariate continuous.

By overcoming the lack of a distributional limit, the study supports the use of the finitely asymptotic empirical Wasserstein distance as a confidence interval (CI) estimator. The generalizability of this approach is demonstrated through a proof of directional Hadamard differentiability, facilitating the testing of whether multivariate random variables are jointly mutually independent. The proposed method builds on the idea of the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion, embedding arbitrary joint product marginals in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and defines the squared distance as the杜洪斯基独立性系数 (DHSIC), enabling non-parametric hypothesis testing through permutation tests and bootstrap analogues.

It highlights the relationship between the spectral density of the process and its coefficient factorization. The spectral density consistency is crucial in driving the bootstrap time series, which generates pseudo-innovations. These pseudo-innovations, in turn, create a pseudo-time process that mimics the true innovation bootstrap proposal. This approach asymptotically provides a wide range of relationships for bootstrapping, including the auto-regressive sieve bootstrap, which is a special case of spectral density-driven bootstrapping. The parametric auto-regressive spectral density bootstrap is also discussed, considering its finite life significance in microarray analysis, where it provides an upper confidence bound for the false discovery proportion (FDP). The methodology employs random permutations to understand the causal relationship, utilizing an expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for variational inference. Despite its theoretical guarantees, the Gaussian EP algorithm's understanding is still limited, and its behavior is analyzed in terms of iterative approximations and convergence to a Gaussian limit. The dynamic behavior of EP is explored, emphasizing its divergence with poor initializations, akin to the Newton-Raphson algorithm.

3. The family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers is combined with auxiliary variables using the Gibbs sampling technique, along with a Taylor expansion of the target density, to permit marginalization. This results in the augmentation of auxiliary variables, leading to marginal samplers that are superior in terms of asymptotic variance but slower in computing time compared to standard MCMC algorithms. The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) and the Preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin Algorithm (PCNL) are introduced as special marginal samplers that offer better performance in terms of effective size per unit of computing time. The implementation of the PCNL algorithm is found to be optimized, surpassing the MALA in a range of tenfold binary classification experiments. The Riemann manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling algorithm is also discussed, explaining remarkable improvements in sampler performance when approximating eigenvalues.

This approach enables the evolution of the intensity over discrete time, addressing novelty in the process. Despite the non-tractability of the infinite-dimensional likelihood, a valid Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is devised, offering flexibility and amenability to direct sampling. The careful characterization of the components enables the inclusion of regression temporal and intensity components, subject to relevant interactions in space and time. The simulated methodology is followed by concluding remarks that provide further insights into the discussed approaches.

This methodological framework, grounded in the Wold representation theorem, allows for the consistent estimation of spectral densities and the bootstrapping of time series data. By employing pseudo-innovations, we extend the spectral density-driven bootstrap to generate bootstrap pseudo-time series that maintain the order dependence structure of the original process. This technique holds promise for enhancing the analysis of linear pseudo-innovations and their application in bootstrap inference.

2. In the realm of time series analysis, the spectral density-driven bootstrap has emerged as a powerful tool for inferring from non-deterministic stationary processes. This approach is predicated on the famous Wold decomposition, which decomposes the process into a coefficient-factorized spectral density. By leveraging this relationship, we establish a consistent estimator for the spectral density and propose a bootstrap method that generates pseudo-innovations, thereby facilitating the bootstrapping of the entire sequence. Our methodology provides an appropriate framework for generating pseudo-time series and linear pseudo-innovations, independently and identically distributed with the true innovations.

The spectral density-driven bootstrap, grounded in the Wold representation, offers a novel perspective on the relationship between spectral densities and the bootstrap process. This method generates pseudo-innovations and pseudo-time series, which are essential for maintaining the order dependence structure of the process. Furthermore, the bootstrap auto-regressive sieve provides a parametric alternative to the spectral density bootstrap, extending the utility of this approach to finite life processes.

4. Microarray data analysis benefits greatly from the application of the bootstrap, particularly in controlling false discoveries. The False Discovery Proportion (FDP) is a crucial metric in this context, and the bootstrap provides an upper confidence bound for FDP, offering exact confidence statements. Remarkably, the bootstrap maintains the upper bound confidence level while potentially underestimating the true FDP probability. This closed test decouples the upper bound confidence level from the random permutation, providing insights into the behavior of the bootstrap in the presence of multiple tests.

5. Expectation Propagation (EP) is a successful algorithm widely applied in statistical inference, offering variational approximations to complex posterior distributions. Despite its widespread use and theoretical guarantees, the Gaussian EP remains poorly understood. We analyze a variant of EP, the Averaged EP, which operates in a smaller space and providesEP-like behavior with iterative newton-like algorithms. The limit of the Averaged EP as the number of iterations increases approaches the Gaussian limit, offering valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of EP and its divergence under poor initialization, akin to the behavior of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.
