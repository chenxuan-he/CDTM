The theoretical properties of these methods ensure that they can provide valid inferences while controlling for false positives in large-scale datasets.

1. [Scaling row-column matrix, transposable meaning, and the independence of row-column instances are discussed in this article. The authors propose a novel method for detecting significant gene microarray dependencies, taking into account the presence of a latent batch effect. The method utilizes a matrix-variate normal distribution to quantify the effect of row-column correlations and provides a solution that decorrelates noise while maintaining the desired error rate. This approach offers increased power, reduced bias, and a smaller variance compared to traditional methods, making it a significant improvement for microarray analysis.][FDR control, dynamic adaptive methods, and their conservative counterparts are examined in the context of multiple hypothesis testing. The authors demonstrate that the dynamic adaptive approach can achieve smaller errors and maintain independence with mild dependence, offering a practical solution for controlling the FDR in complex scenarios. The theoretical connections between FDR control and the conservative FDR are explored, highlighting the strengths of each method.][The authors introduce a novel approach for high-dimensional classification that mitigates the issues of noise accumulation and spectral divergence encountered in naïve applications of the Fisher Discriminant Rule. By incorporating the independence rule and sparse covariance structure, the method significantly reduces misclassification rates and provides a theoretical framework for understanding the reduction in error rates. Comparative studies demonstrate the superior performance of this method over traditional techniques in terms of classification accuracy and stability.]
