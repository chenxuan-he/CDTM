Paragraph 4:
In medical imaging, the size constraints of images differ significantly from traditional interpretation methods, making it crucial to predict outcomes directly. Convolutional neural networks struggle with this task, necessitating the development of deep Kronecker networks. These networks adapt to the low size constraints and offer a versatile interpretation, utilizing matrix tensors to represent images as discrete continuous outcomes. The Kronecker product structure implicitly enforces piecewise smooth properties on the coefficients, resembling fully convolutional networks. This structure allows for strong connections with tensor regression, imposing a canonical low-rank structure on tensor coefficients and enabling efficient classification and regression analyses in medical imaging, such as the effectiveness evaluation of surgical treatments for moderate periodontal disease or the risk factors associated with head and neck cancer.

Paragraph 5:
Despite the existence of extensive functional linear regression methods, there remains a fundamental gap between theory and practice. Ideally, functional data should be analyzed with discrete noise, but challenges arise from the need to derive sharp perturbation bounds for eigenfunctions. Techniques like functional linear regression with pooling achieve eigenfunction splitting strategies, facilitating a theoretical treatment that considers discretely approximated slopes. The use of principal component scores allows for the attainment of eigenfunction splitting, achieving a convergence rate that predicts measurement subjects reaching a magnitude size phase transition phenomenon. This differs from pooled covariance revelations, which indicate elevated difficulties in regression analysis. Empirical experiments simulated favorable responses to high-dimensional response selection, particularly when dealing with diverging predictor sizes in multivariate linear regression. The introduction of a selection indicator and response best subset selectors, which introduce separation penalized least square methods, enables simultaneous response selection and regression coefficient estimation. This approach offers a consistency property for mildly diverging predictors, with asymptotic normality for regression coefficients in high dimensions. The Bonferroni test serves as a special response best subset selector, while the finite response best subset selector demonstrates a strong advantage over competitors like the Matthew correlation coefficient criterion. This approach effectively balances accuracy and true/false response effectiveness, offering a robust solution for applications involving the identification of dosage-sensitive genes.
