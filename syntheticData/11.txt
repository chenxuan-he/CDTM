5. The paper introduces a method for analyzing time series data with a focus on removing the true trend using an ARMA process. This involves detrending the data and examining the residual series, which ideally should follow an ARMA noise pattern. The method is theoretically grounded and computationally efficient, making it user-friendly for practitioners. Trend spline regression is applied to approximate the true trend, and the model is estimated using maximum likelihood. The residual series are then utilized to determine the lag selection for prediction, ensuring the consistent removal of the true trend. The research has seen increased interest in recent years, particularly in the context of approximating the false discovery proportion (FDP). The accuracy of FDP approximation is vital for the method's reliability, and it successfully addresses challenges associated with eigenvalue and eigenvector approximation for banded sparse covariance matrices. By relaxing the assumption of generalized multivariate normality, the method's application is broadened, and its effectiveness is demonstrated in various domains.
