The gamma update step stays close to the particle filter update, avoiding degeneracy and enabling the handling of high-dimensional data with ease.

Text 5: We propose a novel test based on hypothesis constraints within a boundary space, which gives rise to a conservative asymptotic likelihood ratio mixture chi-squared test. This approach yields a guaranteed power improvement over naive methods that ignore boundary constraints. The test is applicable in dimensions with comparable power to the conventional chi-bar test, ensuring accurate results even when true values are difficult to calculate. By specifying a linear constraint on log-linear models and expanding into multivariate Bernoulli marginals, we overcome the drawbacks of parameterization and provide a powerful test for independence relationships. This log-linear approach is particularly useful in identifying clusters of low-probability events with disastrous impacts, aiding in the understanding of rare occurrences and their temporal clustering.
