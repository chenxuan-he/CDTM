The existence of a strict subset space ensures the sparsity of the adaptive confidence vector, allowing for minimal separation in the coefficient space. The model accounts for possibly correlated sub-Gaussian noise and employs an asymptotic power test for sphericity, considering both single-directional and dimensionality effects. The convergence of the hypothesis test is established under the contiguity of log ratios and the joint density of covariance eigenvalues, while the phase transition threshold is determined using the Baik-Ben Aroura-Peche method. The limiting process of the nondegenerate eigenvalue density is analyzed, leading to an asymptotically norm threshold for the test. The Tracy-Widom test provides a non-trivial equal asymptotic size, whereas the eigenvalue likelihood ratio test exhibits a strictly larger size.
