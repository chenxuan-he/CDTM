1. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between self-controlled associations and time-varying exposure on health events. We accounted for confounders, exposure history, and event collection over a predefined period. The study violated the time requirement for independent events, leading to an increased mortality rate during the censoring period. To address the rare and nonrecurring nature of the event, we extended the analysis to remove independence and introduce an additional likelihood censoring process. By reordering the data within the sampled parameter space, we were able to estimable intervals for the event end and exposure effect. Incorporating the age effect, we interpreted the results while considering the effect of censoring. Using fitted loglinear models in statistical software, we yielded conservative error estimates with detailed applications in antipsychotic-related stroke. The study allowed a strong positive relationship between antipsychotic use and dementia in patients with dementia. Detailed supplemental investigations provided further insights into the complex relationship between blood pressure changes and the progression of microalbuminuria in individuals with diabetes.

2. We explored the intricate association between self-controlled associations and the dynamics of exposure on health outcomes. By controlling for covariates and considering the historical context of exposure, we collected data over a specified duration.
