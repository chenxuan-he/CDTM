These statements are crucial for specifying the quantile moments and identifying the expert's probability distribution. However, the usual parametric family fits may not suffice, leading to a clear deficiency in the solution. Expert beliefs often force a fit within a parametric family, while a second-order account might be taken for nonparametric approaches to tackle this deficiency. Integration of missing data, either directly or indirectly, is a challenging issue that often involves complex expectations and likelihood functions. Techniques such as Laplace approximation and marginal likelihood adjustments are used to accommodate the effect of missing data, simplifying the integration process.

2. Elicited probability judgments and solutions often involve the integration of expectations, which can be computed directly or indirectly. This integration is typically done through either analytical, numerical, deterministic, or stochastic methods. Formulating missing data as latent random variables within a hierarchical likelihood framework allows for the use of additional adjustments to precision. Handling integration of missing data mechanisms often necessitates the inclusion of random effects, as seen in the case of Tobit regression for refitting models with missing data. Studies by Diggle, Kenward, and others have analyzed antidepressant trials using kernel density estimation, eschewing explicit boundary corrections and reporting on the comparison of beta kernel densities.

3. Fitting smooth curves often involves selecting an appropriate bandwidth for kernel density estimation. Competitive integrated squared error (CISE) advantages and range considerations make bandwidth selection a crucial step. Chen's automatic bandwidth selection rule-of-thumb provides a practical solution, while maintaining competitiveness with other methods. Kernel density estimation, with its bivariate copula and asymptotic theories, offers a comprehensive approach to density estimation, including the use of the Gaussian copula.

4. Smoothing spline techniques play a significant role in fitting smooth curves, as they allow for dimension unrolling and manifold smoothing. Explicit calculations involving analogous methods, such as Jupp and Kent's spherical spline shape space smoothing, resemble fitting smoothing splines. These methods interpolate infinitely differentiable curves and fit geodesic lines. Computation of fitted paths often involves iterative processes that converge quickly, considering piecewise geodesic paths and human movement tests for appropriateness.

5. Variance estimation in surveys can be challenging, especially when using the jackknife method, which may seriously overestimate the true variance. However, with numerical methods, the jackknife variance can be regularized to ensure consistency. Stratified sampling with unequal probability replacement is a high-entropy method that supports consistency, as seen in Rao-Sampford empirical studies. Maximum likelihood estimation, with its target size and interval asymptotics, is applicable for determining the size of the target population in mark recapture studies, proving unimodality through profile likelihood analysis.

1. The process of extracting expert knowledge involves formulating finite statements that elicit quantile moments, which are crucial for identifying the probability distribution uniquely. Typically, parametric families are preferred due to their clarity and ease of fitting within the expert's belief framework. However, a second consideration is the accommodation of nonparametric methods to address any deficiencies in the elicited statements, which may arise from imprecision or the need for a more flexible model.

2. In the realm of missing data, solutions often involve the integration of expectations, which can be computed directly or indirectly, either analytically, numerically, or through deterministic or stochastic means. Formulating latent random variables within a hierarchical likelihood framework allows for the incorporation of additional adjustments to precision, effectively utilizing Laplace approximations or marginal likelihood adjustments to account for the effects of missing data.

3. Regression techniques, such as the Tobit model, offer a means to refit models in the presence of missing data, as seen in the analysis of antidepressant trials by Diggle, Kenward, and others. Kernel density estimation, on the other hand, provides an alternative approach, eschewing explicit boundary corrections and utilizing bivariate copulas based on asymptotic theories, such as the Gaussian copula, to report competitive integrated squared errors.

4. Smoothing techniques in curve fitting often involve the use of landmark dimensions, unrolling, and unwrapping in Riemannian manifolds. Explicit calculations, akin to those in the works of Jupp and Kent, demonstrate the use of spherical splines for shape space smoothing, resembling the fitting of smoothing splines. Zero-curvature interpolation and geodesic lines are used to fit paths in a computationally efficient manner, with iterative methods converging quickly to the desired path.

5. The jackknife method is applied to surveys to seriously underestimate true variances, particularly when using unistage stratified sampling with replacement and unequal probability. The consistency of the jackknife variance estimate holds under regularity conditions, as supported by Rao-Sampford empirical results, indicating its reliability in situations with high entropy regularity.
