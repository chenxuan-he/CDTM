2. In the context of the capture-recapture experiment, the abundance of individuals needs to be closed account for heterogeneity. The capture probability is modelled parametrically, with individual characteristics left unspecified. The conditional likelihood, based on the Empirical Maximum Likelihood (EML) approach, produces Wald Confidence Intervals (CIs) for abundance. Despite the strong skewed right distribution of the capture data, the EML CIs provide a lower limit that is less than the number of captured individuals. The Huggins and Alho semiparametric model demonstrates that the Empirical Likelihood Ratio (ELR) for abundance asymptotically approaches a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of maximum empirical likelihood. This empirical likelihood approach achieves semiparametric efficiency and offers better coverage compared to conditional likelihood CIs, with smaller square errors.
