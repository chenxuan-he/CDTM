Paragraph 1:
The power property of the quadratic distance goodness-of-fit test lies in its ability to assess the fit of a model by considering the kernel function. This kernel function enters the selection process easily and normal approximation is used to enhance its power. The test is based on the construction of a noncentrality index, which is akin to the traditional noncentrality but has some key differences.

Constructing a kernel with a midpower device enables the selection of the degree of freedom and diffusion kernel family. The Pearson normal kernel extends normal approximation. The fertility trends in rich countries are critically slowing down, with women in their reproductive years postponing or reducing their lifetime fertility. Bayesian fertility forecasting incorporates historical patterns as prior information, constructing an improper prior with high weight on historically plausible rate surfaces. The Human Fertility Database constructs an age-time schedule to approximate the principal component, smoothing the linear short span and calibrating the prior approximation. The quadratic penalty high-dimensional normal posterior suggests a fertility surface forecast. The forecasts indicate a slight rebound in completed fertility, likely in central and southern Europe, East Asia, and Brazil, while the rebound is less likely in the United States, northern Europe, and western Europe.
