Sequential probability ratio tests (SPAR) have been developed to address the challenges associated with parameterized hidden Markov models. These tests leverage the renewal property of the hidden Markov chain and employ a stopping rule based on the cumulative sum of the sequence. The SPAR tests offer asymptotic optimality and are conditionally valid when the central limit theorem holds. Moreover, these tests have been extended to handle nonparametric scenarios, where the innovation density is not assumed to be Gaussian. The flexibility of these tests makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, including digital communication, speech recognition, and bioinformatics.

The bootstrap has also been integrated with other techniques, such as the periodogram analysis, to improve the validity of stochastic process models. This integration enables the capture of essential features of the data, resulting in more accurate and reliable statistical inferences.
