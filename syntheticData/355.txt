4. The Bayesian inverse covariance matrix is explored, with a Gaussian prior on the diagonal elements of the inverse covariance matrix. The application of parsimonious parameterisation allows for the structure of the covariance matrix to be made graphically explicit, and the methodology is applied to high-dimensional data, where relative size considerations are essential. The use of the Metropolis-Hastings sampling scheme produces statistically efficient estimates of the inverse covariance matrix, exploiting the sparsity of the methodology in the context of high-dimensional data.

5. The development of a recent likelihood theory is discussed, which successfully produces highly accurate third-order scalar determinants in a moderate regularity framework. The likelihood component is motivated through the consideration of a normal error model in a location-scale context, indicating the achievement of third-order accuracy in the determination of parameters. The implementation of the theory is straightforward, leveraging familiar ingredients from the full maximum likelihood estimation with constraints on the nuisance parameters. The calibration of the nuisance parameters is performed through a relative symmetric choice of exponential reparameterisation, providing a recent theory that is easily computed and motivating in detail.
