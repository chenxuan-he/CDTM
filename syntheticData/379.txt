The Adaptive Dantzig Selector ensures that the selected predictors are highly likely to be informative, and their dimension converges to infinity asymptotically. The method is numerically confirmed to outperform existing dimension reduction and predictor selection methods in linear regression models.

4. The text introduces an innovative strategy for constructing efficient semiparametric regression models by employing dimensionality reduction techniques. It highlights the role of sliced inverse regression in selecting the most contributing predictors, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the predictors. The proposed approach provides a non-asymptotic error bound and generalizes the regularization concept. Furthermore, the Adaptive Dantzig Selector ensures the selection of highly probable contributing predictors, leading to an efficient predictor dimension that diverges as the number of predictors increases. Empirical studies, including the analysis of Colorado Plateau uranium miners' data, provide supportive evidence for the superiority of the proposed dimension reduction and predictor selection method.

5. This article presents a comprehensive study on the construction of strong orthogonal arrays with superior space-filling properties for computer experiments. The authors propose a novel approach that combines blocked levels with regular weak minimum factors to construct weak minimum aberration designs. These designs not only minimize aberrations but also enjoy better space-filling properties compared to traditional Latin hypercube designs. The proposed method ensures that the lower dimensions retain the desired space-filling properties, making it a valuable tool for computer experiments.

Paragraph 1:
The integration of sliced inverse regression with the Dantzig selector facilitates the dimensionality reduction in semiparametric regression models, allowing for the selection of informative linear combinations of predictors. This approach effectively reduces the dimensionality of the predictors while minimizing the error in semiparametric regression. The adaptive Dantzig selector ensures that the selected contributing predictors are highly probable, leading to an asymptotically normal predictor dimension that does not diverge to infinity. Empirical evidence supports the theoretical proposal, demonstrating its superiority in dimensionality reduction and predictor selection over linear regression.

Paragraph 2:
In the context of accelerated failure time models, the efficient score density is proposed to arise from a multiple root complication. By employing the plug-in rule, the efficient counting process and martingale advantage are utilized to avoid multiple root initializations and efficiently handle the variance. This results in an effective driven bandwidth selector that is proven to be semiparametrically efficient with an asymptotic variance that is efficient and an error location shift that is numerically supportive.

Paragraph 3:
The construction of blocked levels in regression models aims to minimize aberrations caused by aliased block effects. By combining weak minimum aberration with blocked levels, a scenario is created that constructs arrays with strong orthogonal properties suitable for computer experiments. These strong orthogonal arrays enjoy a better space-filling property compared to comparable orthogonal arrays, even when the latter have a lower dimension. This retention of the space-filling property is crucial for the efficacy of the constructed arrays.

Paragraph 4:
The development of the strong orthogonal array, which is a suitable design for computer experiments, is based on the concept of space-filling properties. These arrays possess strengths that are comparable to orthogonal arrays, but with a lower dimension. The Latin hypercube, in this context, is a strong orthogonal array that offers a space-filling advantage, making it superior for use in computer experiments where the goal is to effectively explore the design space.

Paragraph 5:
The application of sliced inverse regression in the context of uranium miners in the Colorado Plateau highlights the construction of blocked levels to minimize aberrations. This approach employs a weak minimum aberration principle and considers aliased block effects to construct arrays with strong orthogonal properties. These arrays are particularly suitable for computer experiments due to their enhanced space-filling properties, which are retained even when the dimensions are lower compared to comparable orthogonal arrays.
