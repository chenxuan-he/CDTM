Traditional methods often struggle to provide accurate results when faced with such complexity. However, a new approach known as Holp Holp has emerged as a potential solution to this problem. Holp Holp is a nonparametric method designed to screen out irrelevant variables and significantly reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving the true underlying structure. This method demonstrates good coverage in confidence interval estimation and offers a consistent selection process with strong correlation. Furthermore, Holp Holp is computationally efficient, making it suitable for applications in various fields, including mammalian eye disease.

A significant challenge in this context is selecting predictors when the number of predictors greatly exceeds the number of observations in ultrahigh-dimensional settings. To address this, an independence screening method is proposed, which significantly reduces dimensionality while maintaining the true underlying relationships with high probability. This refined stage builds on the aforementioned sure screening property, which strongly depends on the marginal correlation of the response variable. However, in real-world scenarios, this property is rarely maintained, and traditional screening techniques may not be effective in high-dimensional settings. In comparison, the hierarchical orthogonal least squares (HOLP) projection offers a competitive solution, especially when there is a strong correlation between predictors and the response variable. The HOLP method performs well in terms of marginal correlation and is particularly appealing for applications such as predicting mammalian eye diseases. Moreover, Bayesian methods argue that it is valid to update prior beliefs based on posterior probabilities, which is more connected to the true generating mechanism than traditional likelihood methods. This modern application area presents increasingly challenging problems, and Bayesian approaches attempt to recover the true likelihood, especially in low-dimensional cases where complete wholes are cumbersome to achieve. Importantly, the Bayesian updating process directly involves the index family density, making Bayesian learning a currently relevant and promising approach. The decision-theoretic framework involves cumulative loss, which importantly coincides with Bayesian updating, highlighting the coherent subjective connection between loss functions and Bayesian updating in this context.
