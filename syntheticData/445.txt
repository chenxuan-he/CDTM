Let \( \mathbf{X} \) be a centered random vector with \( \mathbf{X} \) taking values on a circle, and let \( \mathbf{X} \) satisfy the norm equivalence property. Sometimes, this is referred to as a bounded kurtosis covariance cap, which exhibits almost an expected Gaussian vector. Improving the current state-of-the-art regarding high probability bounds and sub-Gaussian sharp expectations with constant probability scenarios, the bound is explicitly dimension-dependent and offers a rather effective rank covariance matrix.

The Poisson process, characterized by its intensity \( \lambda \), has frequentist properties and can be reconstructed using Bayesian methods. The support boundary of the compound Poisson process is mainly compound, and its prior intensity can be proven to lead to a posterior contract that is nearly rate monotone and support boundary adaptable. The compound Poisson process prior space increases with dimension, and the marginal posterior functional performs automatic bias correction, contracting faster than the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) \( \alpha \) with a credible asymptotic \( \alpha \) confidence interval. The credible interval's coverage can be negatively impacted if the frequentist coverage is lost outside the linear region.

Stochastic volatility models, which are order parabolic stochastic PDEs, assume solutions with high temporal frequencies. A limit theorem for multipower variation functionals is constructed to construct consistent nonparametric asymptotic confidence bounds for the integrated volatility process. This approach includes feasible regularity and spatial covariance noise.

The previous nonlinear shrinkage was of a numerical nature, and the quest for a numerical inversion of complex equations using random matrix theory led to a splitting scheme that is analytical and elegant, with potential to accommodate future variations and extensions. The immediate benefit of this approach is a faster time to convergence, essentially accurate for covering covariance matrix dimensions that are difficult to accommodate.
