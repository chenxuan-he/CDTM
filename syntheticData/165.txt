1. In the field of causal inference, researchers often encounter the challenge of adjusted treatment comparisons that are confounded by post-treatment factors. To address this issue, the concept of principal stratification within the framework of potential outcomes is crucial. It allows for the handling of intermediate causal effects and offers a solution to the inferential challenges posed by dichotomizing intermediate variables. Fully parametric models may not adequately represent the complex distributional features, such as clustering, but Bayesian semiparametric models provide flexibility in modeling potential outcomes.

The application of these models to randomized clinical trials with partial compliance is particularly useful for investigating causal mechanisms, such as the relationship between physical activity, body mass index, and cardiovascular disease.

2. Counting distinct elements and inferring their cardinality is a fundamental task in database management, especially relevant in recent years as the volume of data has increased. Probabilistic sampling and sketching techniques from computer science have been employed to estimate cardinality with limited computing resources. These methods are scale invariant in the sense that they maintain a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) that is desirable for applications requiring accurate cardinality estimation. Bitmaps are a binary vector representation that can be updated adaptively during the sampling process, reducing the sampling rate and achieving unbiased scale-invariant estimation with lower memory usage and fewer operations. State-of-the-art cardinality estimation techniques balance scale invariance with experimental results reported in the literature.

3. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) is a widely used tool for gene quantification in scientific research.

Multivariate processes and high-dimensional data pose challenges for change detection. Nonparametric tests that leverage the combinatorial properties of minimum non-bipartite matching (MNBM) can be employed. These tests are based on the idea of independently randomizing sequences and detecting abrupt shifts or gradual drifts. The MNBM has the advantage of producing pairings that are closer in sequence, and it can be extended to include other ideas such as minimum spanning trees or ensemble methods to increase extraction and maintain good power properties across tests.

Supplemental methods are provided to enhance the analysis of qPCR experiments and to achieve more accurate gene quantitation.

4. Detecting changes in sequence data is a challenging task with various applications, including health prognostics, mechanical systems, and syndromic disease surveillance. Multivariate process control and high-dimensional data pose additional challenges. Nonparametric tests that leverage the combinatorial properties of minimum non-bipartite matching (MNBM) can effectively detect changes. The MNBM test is based on the idea of matching sequences independently and randomly, undergoing abrupt shifts or gradual drifts. The inter-distance between sequences tends to produce pairings closer to each other. The test follows Rosenbaum's MNBM cross-match test idea and utilizes an ensemble of orthogonal MNBM to greatly increase the extraction of change information. This approach maintains good power properties across dimensions and offers a favorable alternative to parametric tests.

5. Flexible prediction error modeling with multiple test dependence is achieved through probit transformation and multivariate skew-normal mixture modeling. This approach incorporates dependence and shape restrictions into the density estimation, allowing for nonparametric Bayesian schemes. The component mixture is outlined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which enables the prediction of false discovery proportion and the estimation of credible bands for expression levels. The key quantity in multiple testing is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is positively dependent on power and mixture. This methodology is applied to the analysis of kidney transplant data, where subset selection and regression are crucial aspects of Bayesian analysis. The Bayesian paradigm addresses uncertainty by considering subset selection and posterior calculation, combining Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for conceptually straightforward yet difficult implementation. BMA can be facilitated by nonorthogonal matrices and augmentation algorithms, which keep the original posterior unaltered while constructing Rao-Blackwellized quantities. This approach is applicable to linear regression, binary regression, and nonorthogonal matrices in conjunction with independent spike-slab priors for continuous components.

Dealing with these issues requires the use of principal stratification and handling potential outcomes within the framework of causal inference. This is particularly challenging when dealing with intermediate variables, as dichotomizing them can lead to a loss of information and arbitrary choices of cutoff points may inadequately represent the complex distributional features. Bayesian semiparametric and nonparametric methods offer flexibility in modeling potential outcomes, with the Dirichlet process mixture providing a way to capture clustering features. These methods offer better interpretability and can be applied to a variety of fields, including the analysis of randomized clinical trials, physical activity and its impact on body mass index and cardiovascular disease, and the Swedish National March Cohort study.
2. Counting distinct elements, or cardinality estimation, is a fundamental problem in database management and has gained significant attention in recent years. Addressing this issue in data streams, where elements are seen only once and stored for a long period, requires probabilistic sampling and sketching techniques from computer science. These methods are useful in limited computing memory situations and can be made scale invariant in the sense of relative root mean square error (RRMSE). Bitmaps are a scale-invariant cardinality estimation method that uses a binary vector, with entries updated adaptively during the sampling process. This approach can achieve lower RRMSE with significantly less memory and fewer operations, making it a state-of-the-art method for cardinality estimation in data streams.

However, current methods for analyzing qPCR data fail to account for the multiple sources of variability inherent in PCR experiments. A dynamic PCR model that incorporates random effects can account for within-reaction variability, leading to less biased and more accurate gene quantification. This methodology, supplemented by asymptotic theory, has been shown to improve gene quantification in PCR experiments using fluorescence detection.
4. Detecting changes in sequences is a problem of interest in various applications, such as health prognostics, mechanical systems, and syndromic disease surveillance. In high-dimensional settings, this problem becomes particularly challenging. Nonparametric tests that leverage the combinatorial properties of minimum non-bipartite matching (MNBM) can be used to detect changes in sequences. The key idea behind these tests is to match sequences independently and randomly, and then detect abrupt shifts or gradual drifts in the matched pairs. MNBM has the advantage of producing pairings that are closer in sequence, and the test can be modified to follow the ideas of Rosenbaum or to use a cross-match test. Another approach is to use the minimum spanning tree (MST) test, as proposed by Friedman and Rafsky, which utilizes an ensemble of orthogonal MNBMs to greatly increase the power of the test while maintaining good power properties across different scenarios.
5. In the context of choosing a subset for regression or generalized linear models, the Bayesian paradigm offers a way to address uncertainty by considering the posterior probabilities of subsets. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is a conceptually straightforward but computationally challenging method that involves averaging over all possible models. To implement BMA, nonorthogonal matrices can be used to augment the original design matrix, generating missing responses through an augmentation algorithm. This approach keeps the original posterior unchanged and constructs a Rao-Blackwellized quantity to approximate the posterior probabilities. BMA has been applied to linear regression, binary regression, and nonorthogonal matrices, often in conjunction with independent spike-and-slab priors. This methodology is particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets and offers a flexible way to handle uncertainty in model selection.
