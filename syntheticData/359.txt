The manuscript extends the generated latent Gaussian graphical models to include a differential network, which is decomposed into sparse low-rank components and a symmetric indefinite matrix component. This approach is implemented in stages, including an initialization stage, a computation stage with consistent convergence, and an implementation stage with a nonconvex objective. The nonconvex objective is initialized and converges linearly, achieving a nontrivial minimax error. The experiment with synthetic nonconvex data outperforms the baseline.

Article 1:
The growth rate of bacterial populations and the assembly of their genomes have become a critical area of research, particularly in the context of metagenomics and the analysis of gut bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The use of permuted monotone matrix elements, NxP, and the rank of signal matrices has led to significant advancements in the field. By examining the last column difference in extreme signal matrices and treating compound decisions with a minimax rate, researchers have constructed spectral column sorting algorithms that can effectively handle noise matrices. Through numerical experiments involving simulated synthetic microbiomes, these techniques have been demonstrated to be superior compared to traditional methods for analyzing growth rates in gut bacteria.

The application of digital technology in healthcare has led to the development of wearable devices that can deliver personalized mobile health interventions. These interventions are increasingly being used in randomized trials to inform the construction of interventions for individuals in their daily lives. The primary outcome of these micro randomized trials is often a longitudinal binary outcome, and the primary aim is to examine whether the time-varying intervention effect has a significant impact on this outcome. The concept of causal excursion effect plays a crucial role in this context, providing insights into the potential causal effects of interventions.

The use of subsampling techniques in quantile regression has gained attention for its ability to minimize the asymptotic variance of covariance matrices. These techniques involve linear transformations of the original data, which simplifies the implementation of the algorithm and improves its scalability. The use of subsampling probabilities and iterative subsampling strategies has led to great advances in the field, providing a more efficient way to yield error density responses. Numerical simulations have demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods, and they have been widely utilized in various applications, including the analysis of genetic regulation and gene expression across multiple tissues.

The use of mixed Bayesian asymptotically ideal (BIA) property in regression analysis has opened up new avenues for understanding high-dimensional data. This property allows for the estimation of rates of convergence and provides a framework for controlling relevant error rates. The hierarchical tree structure of the BIA property enables fast algorithms and guarantees a range of dependencies that are desired for the analysis of complex data. The application of this property to the analysis of genetic regulation and gene expression across multiple tissues has demonstrated its effectiveness in uncovering important biological relationships, including those involving gut microbiome and colorectal cancer.

The use of instrumental variable analysis in dealing with unmeasured confounding in observational studies has gained prominence in recent years. This approach allows researchers to identify the local average treatment effect and address the challenge of causal inference in imperfect randomized controlled trials. The use of a continuous treatment and imposing weak structural continuity provides a theoretical framework for testing instrument validity. The computational properties of the instrumental variable approach make it an attractive choice for analyzing complex data, and its application in the study of housing interventions and risky behaviors among adolescent girls has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions.

Shotgun metagenomics, in particular, has revolutionized our understanding of microbial ecosystems by enabling the study of complex microbial communities. The permuted monotone matrix element nxp, along with the rank signal matrix and monotone row element pxp, have been crucial in approximating the noise matrix and identifying extreme signal matrices. The last column difference in these matrices has played a vital role in treating compound decisions and minimizing the minimax rate. This computational approach, constructed through spectral column sorting and numerical experiments, has demonstrated its superiority in comparing growth rates of gut bacteria in patients with inflammatory bowel disease to those of control subjects.

Their asymptotic theory has expanded upon theoretical findings, allowing for finite differences in rate convergence. The bagged cross-validation bandwidth quantifies the improvement in efficiency and computational speed, offering a distinct advantage over the binned implementation of ordinary cross-validation. This bagged bandwidth, a byproduct of the correction error, has shown significant error reduction, further enhancing the reliability of the results.

3. The advancements in digital technology have made wearable devices capable of delivering personalized, behavioral, and mobile health interventions on an individual basis. Randomized trials, such as micro randomized trials, have increasingly informed the construction of these interventions. The primary outcome of these trials often focuses on longitudinal binary outcomes, examining whether the time-varying intervention effect influences these outcomes. The primary aim of micro randomized trials is to explore whether such interventions can have a causal effect on these binary outcomes, potentially offering insights into the causal excursion effect.

4. The use of mixed Bayesian inference analysis (mixed BIA) has proven to be a valuable tool in characterizing the property of asymptotically efficient causal effect estimation. This property allows for a doubly robust and consistent asymptotically normal estimation process. By admitting a rate of convergence that is slower for nuisance parameters and faster for the main parameters, the mixed BIA property offers a possibility to trade off rates of convergence. This flexibility is essential for successfully characterizing causal relationships in mixed BIA, especially when influence functions are minimized with respect to nuisance losses and penalized nuisance losses.

This approach has yielded an easy-to-implement algorithm with great scalability, allowing for the utilization of computational resources more efficiently. The resulting error density responses have been numerically simulated to validate the methodology, paving the way for more sophisticated studies in the future.
