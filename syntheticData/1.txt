The dynamic factor model (DFM) is a powerful tool for analyzing high-dimensional data, offering theoretical properties that are both identifiable and accurate. It captures the separable low-dimensional effects inherent in the data, allowing for interpretable insights. The row-column attribute correlations are taken into account, providing a complementary view of the dynamic factors.

Controlling the familywise error rate (FDR) in selection procedures is critical for reproducible discovery, especially in extensively sparse linear scenarios. Direct imposition of sparsity constraints through linear transformations is a challenging open problem. However, techniques such as the fused lasso, trend filtering, and adaptive FDR control via split knockoff transformational sparsity have emerged. These methods exploit splitting in linear transformations, relaxing the Euclidean proximity constraint and enabling orthogonal split knockoff constructions. This overcomes the challenge of exchangeability and the heterogeneity of noise, providing provable FDR control while sacrificing minimal power.
