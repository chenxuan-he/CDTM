Paragraph 1:
The analysis of heavy-tailed innovations in time series has been less explored, particularly in the context of constructing goodness-of-fit tests. The necessity to impose moments on the innovations leads to a bounded random variable, which, in turn, necessitates a transformation of the residuals to address the issue of autocorrelation. Specifically, the transformed absolute residuals are fitted to a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model, which empirical evidence suggests is a robust approach. The construction of an asymptotic test hypothesis, along with local Monte Carlo experiments, allows for the examination of the finite sample properties of the test, rendering it a powerful tool for detecting heavy-tailed innovations.

Paragraph 2:
In the realm of statistical inference, the bootstrap recipe post-selection is often employed to correct for model misspecifications. Constraining the residuals within a parsimonious framework approximately guarantees correct inference, provided that the wrong candidate models are sufficiently separated from the approximately correct one. This theory encompasses a broad selection criteria and is validated through sparse empirical simulations.

1. The analysis of long-tailed innovations in goodness-of-fit testing has been relatively overlooked, with much of the focus directed towards autocorrelation structures. The construction of a goodness-of-fit test inherently requires the imposition of moment conditions on the innovations, which are necessarily bounded random variables. This paper addresses the transformation of residuals to ensure that they are both bounded and specifically autocorrelated, fitting a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model to the transformed absolute residuals. The empirical application of this robust goodness-of-fit test is naturally employed, with transformations robust to heavy-tailed innovations. A bootstrap recipe is proposed that post-selects models based on least squares linear regression, constraining the residuals within a parsimonious framework.

In the absence of leverage effects and jumps, the studentized realized variance local bootstrapping provides an accurate order, extensively verified against theory.

4. The investigation of time-series data with heavy-tailed innovations has been a less explored area in goodness-of-fit testing, with the majority of research focusing on the construction of autocorrelation-based tests. The moment conditions necessary for such tests inherently impose limitations on the innovations, restricting them to be bounded random variables. This paper addresses this issue by transforming the residuals to exhibit both boundedness and autocorrelation, fitting a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic model to the transformed absolute residuals. The empirical implementation of this robustness-enhanced goodness-of-fit test is自然的，利用 transformations that are robust to heavy-tailed innovations. A bootstrap recipe that post-selects models using least squares linear regression is proposed, constraining the residuals within a parsimonious framework.
