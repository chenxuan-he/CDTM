1. Employing a dynamic principal components analysis (PCA) technique, we decompose the time series into a set of orthonormal vectors, each representing a distinct component of variability. By iteratively applying a stationary vector transformation, we identify segments of the data that exhibit contemporaneous linear relationships, enabling us to analyze these segments separately in a lower-dimensional space. This process effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data for subsequent linear dynamic structure analysis, ensuring that each segment's volatility process is examined in a more parsimonious framework.

2. Utilizing a modified PCA approach, we isolate segments of the time series that correspond to contemporaneous linear transformations, facilitating the partitioning of the data into uncorrelated subsets at each time point. Serial segmentation allows for the analysis of these subsets independently, providing a clearer picture of the underlying linear dynamic structure.

To advance, a permutation-based approach complemented by the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing methodology is adopted. This combination is particularly potent in managing cases where sample sizes expand indefinitely. Through meticulous numerical simulations, the efficacy of this method as a foundational step in the analysis of numerous time series, achieving significant dimension reduction, has been demonstrated. This approach is especially beneficial for deciphering complex high-dimensional linear dynamical structures, offering a stark contrast to the traditional PCA which lacks the assurance of a guaranteed linear transformation and accurate segmentation, making it a formidable tool for predicting future occurrences in light of multifaceted volatility processes.

3. This study employs principal component analysis (PCA) to arrange stationary vectors in a manner that imparts a time-sensitive perspective to the data. By pursuing linear transformations that are contemporary in nature, the data is accordingly reduced to a less complex, segmented form, where each segment is free from temporal correlations. These segments, which are now in a more manageable lower-dimensional space, are then subjected to individual analysis, with an emphasis on the linear dynamics inherent within the structure. To refine the process, an additional step incorporating permutations and the application of the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing approach is implemented. This serves to bolster the methodology, particularly effective in contexts where the sample sizes become increasingly substantial. Through a series of numerical experiments, simulations have confirmed the method's prowess as an integral first step in dissecting numerous time series with considerable dimension reduction. It is particularly well-suited for modeling and predicting high-dimensional linear dynamical systems, offering distinct advantages over PCA in terms of ensuring a linear transformation and precise segmentation, thereby enhancing the forecasting of future developments involving intricate volatility processes.

4. In the context of this research, principal component analysis (PCA) is leveraged to orchestrate stationary vectors in a way that elucidates the temporal component of the data. The pursuit of such contemporary linear transformations culminates in the segmentation of the data into lower-dimensional subsets that are devoid of contemporaneous and serial correlations. These subsets are subsequently analyzed separately, with the linear dynamic structure being the focal point. To augment the analysis, a permutation-based method in conjunction with the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing technique is adopted. This amalgamation is particularly advantageous when dealing with expanding sample sizes. Extensive numerical simulations have shown that this method is a robust initial step in the analysis of multiple time series, facilitating significant dimension reduction, and is particularly adept at deciphering complex high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. This technique outperforms PCA as it guarantees the existence of a linear transformation and provides precise segmentation, thereby bolstering the forecasting of future trends within multifaceted volatility processes.

5. The methodology presented in this study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to arrange stationary vectors in a manner that captures the essence of time, thereby seeking contemporary linear transformations that lead to the segmentation of the data into subsets in a lower dimensional space, which are contemporaneously and serially uncorrelated. These subsets are then individually analyzed with a focus on the linear dynamic structure of interest. To further refine the analysis, an additional step involving permutations and the application of the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing method is employed. This approach is particularly effective in managing cases where the sample sizes tend to infinity. Numerical experiments, simulated under various scenarios, indicate that this method serves as an effective initial step in the analysis of multiple time series, achieving substantial dimension reduction, and is particularly well-suited for modeling and forecasting high-dimensional linear dynamical structures. Unlike PCA, this technique ensures the existence of a required linear transformation and provides approximate segmentation, offering significant advantages in forecasting future trends adapted to complex volatility processes.
