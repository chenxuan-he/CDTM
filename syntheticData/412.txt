Such efficiency makes the pre-weighted bootstrap iteration particularly well-suited for applications in smooth regression analysis, as numerically demonstrated, showcasing its potential practicality and utility.

5. Utilizing the prepivoting weighted bootstrap iteration, an iterative process that meticulously refines pivot point selection, yields increasingly accurate confidence interval construction. The method employs weights chosen with empirical considerations to achieve asymptotic equivalence with consecutive iterations of the conventional bootstrap, leading to a significant reduction in the order of error. Consequently, the prepivoting technique effectively enhances the efficiency of the weighted bootstrap iteration, making it a valuable tool for smooth regression analysis, as numerically illustrated, confirming its potential practical applications and usefulness.
