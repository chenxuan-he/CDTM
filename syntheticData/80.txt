1. This study introduces a novel approach called Simultaneous Multiscale Change (SMC) that addresses the challenges of detecting changes in exponential family regression models. By minimizing the change acceptance region and employing a multiscale test with level \(\alpha\), we aim to balance the probability of overestimating and underestimating true changes. The choice of \(\alpha\) maximizes the probability of correctly identifying changes, resulting in an asymptotically honest confidence step. The proposed method constructs an exponentially bounds probability, controlling the false discovery rate and yielding a minimax rate for logarithmic simultaneous multiscale change detection. This technique has been applied to cutting-edge applications such as genetic engineering and photoemission spectroscopy, where the increasing prevalence of public databases necessitates efficient methods for controlling false discoveries.

This variant of Alpha Investing controls the MFDR, ensuring both cost savings and quality preservation.
