The strategy is computationally efficient, yielding parsimonious and variable-rich results. Adaptive oracle selection strategies provide robustness with a minimax guarantee, integrating functional CAM theory and random regularity with projection methods. These approaches are particularly effective for data with mild correlations. The research suggests potential applications, with simulated data providing empirical validation for the methodology. This could lead to significant computational advantages. Despite the challenge of model misspecification, the method exhibits consistent selection of the true model within the candidate pool, as evidenced by criterion selection in European currency opinion surveys.
