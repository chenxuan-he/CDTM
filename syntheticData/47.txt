Paragraph [Testing the impact of high-dimensional regression coefficients on generalized linear models, Goeman's approach assesses the asymptotic validity of diverging dimension robust accommodating wide range of link functions. The evaluation of multiple gene tests in lung cancer demonstrated the principal strata analysis in randomized experiments, post-treatment endpoint identification, and causal effect estimation within principal strata. Principal stratification was applied in an adjuvant colon cancer clinical trial to identify the principal causal effect across multiple trials, removing exclusion restrictions and ensuring homogeneity. The analysis satisfied causal necessity and sufficiency, highlighting the importance of sensitivity analysis in Bayesian hierarchical models. Efficiently detecting local changes in a piecewise stationary process using likelihood ratio scans, the method efficiently reduces computationally infeasible global searches to locally computed windows. Constructing confidence intervals for changes in the experiment efficiently balanced the treatment and control groups, achieving exact moment calibration. The global semiparametric efficiency of the average treatment effect was achieved through balancing, outperforming direct propensity score outcome regressions. The method's efficiency and consistency involved additional functional propensity score outcome regression variance, providing a better alternative to direct approximations. Applying Hilbert space-filling curves, the method uniformly distributed deterministic sampling discrepancy, surpassing random stratified sampling techniques. The scrambled van der Corput method achieved a better squared error integration rate for lipschitz continuous integrands, overcoming the issue of deteriorating sampling grids with increasing dimensions. The space-filling curve sampling method, particularly the Sierpinski Peano curve, offered an extendable piecewise lipschitz structure with rectifiable discontinuities, achieving a better rate than previously known methods. The upper bound on the rate of the Lebesgue curve was somewhat worse but still effective for high-dimensional log-time integration.

These tests maintain significance levels, detect local hypotheses, and are fast in achieving global hypotheses detection, demonstrating the efficiency of local smoothing tests in comparison to parametric single-index tests. The methodology is readily extended to global smoothing tests for broader application.]

2. In the realm of principal stratification, causal analysis via randomized experiments is enhanced by the post-treatment endogeneity approach. This method identifies the causal effect within principal strata, which are defined by the potential outcomes after treatment. In the context of adjuvant colon cancer clinical trials, it allows for the precise identification of the principal causal effect, thereby removing exclusion restrictions and promoting the assessment of homogeneity across trials.

3. The principle of causal sufficiency is often violated in real-world scenarios, necessitating the use of robust methods such as the likelihood ratio scan for detecting multiple changes in a piecewise stationary process. This scan reduces the computational complexity of searching for global changes and facilitates the efficient performance of local window computations. Moreover, the construction of confidence intervals for changes in the experiment efficiently leverages the likelihood ratio scan, providing a practical approach for estimating the average treatment effect in observational studies.

4. Nonparametric methods for propensity score outcome regression face challenges due to the curse of dimensionality, leading to slow rate convergence in classical hypothesis testing. However, recent advancements in global semiparametric efficiency have shown that by balancing the treatment and control groups, it is possible to achieve exact moment calibration and improve the efficiency of the average treatment effect estimation. This is achieved without relying on direct propensity score methods, which often result in inefficient variance estimates.

5. Sampling techniques play a pivotal role in high-dimensional data analysis, with space-filling curves like the Sierpinski Peano curve offering substantial improvements in integration accuracy. These curves provide an upper bound on the rate of sampling errors, outperforming traditional grids in dimensions where the curse of dimensionality prevails. The use of such curves allows for the efficient estimation of integrals with lipschitz continuous integrands, avoiding the rapid deterioration of accuracy typically associated with increasing dimensions.

Paragraph [Testing the regression coefficient in high-dimensional generalized linear models, with an emphasis on Goeman's test. This approach is asymptotically valid and applicable in diverging dimensions, offering robustness across a wide range of link functions and power properties. The test evaluates the significance of family-wise hypotheses in the presence of nuisance parameters and is suitable for testing multiple genes in the context of lung cancer. The application of this method in a principal strata analysis of a randomized experiment involving adjuvant colon cancer demonstrated the ability to identify the principal causal effect within specified strata, facilitating causal analysis. The method removed exclusion restrictions by demonstrating identifiability of the principal causal effect across multiple trials, necessitating the removal of another monotonicity assumption for local identifiability. In the context of adjuvant colon cancer clinical trials, applying this method resolved the issue of untenable monotonicity assumptions for disease-free survival as a valid surrogate endpoint for overall survival, satisfying causal necessity and causal sufficiency sensitivity analyses. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to explore deviations from homogeneity in the likelihood ratio scan for multiple changes, reducing computationally intensive infeasible global searches to efficient local window computations. Additionally, the construction of confidence intervals for changes in the experiment efficiently utilized the likelihood ratio scan, demonstrating the average treatment effect in observational studies with globally efficient nonparametric methods. The propensity score outcome regression approach achieved calibration efficiency by balancing the treated and control groups, attaining exact moment-to-moment balance without relying on direct propensity score methods, which are consistent and efficient due to additional functional considerations. The use of a Hilbert space-filling curve allowed for uniformly distributed deterministic sampling, improving the discrepancy in random stratified sampling compared to traditional gridded methods, which deteriorate with increasing dimension. The application of the scrambled van der Corput sequence provided a more efficient approach to piecewise lipschitz functions with rectifiable discontinuities, offering a rate of convergence that outperforms previous methods. The use of a Sierpinski Peano curve achieved a desirable rate of convergence for high-dimensional integration problems, where the Lebesgue curve bound is somewhat worse. The local smoothing test for multivariate nonparametric regression overcomes the curse of dimensionality, maintaining a fast rate of convergence for local hypotheses testing while adapting to different levels of significance. This method extends the concept of adaptive testing to parametric single-index models, behaving similarly to local smoothing tests while being univariate consistent and conducting global hypothesis testing at a fast rate, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and demonstrating the effectiveness of local smoothing techniques in high dimensions.]
