This method is found to have an average run length, but the targeted control limit ARL achieves a high probability of detecting both short and long runs, indicating a substantial run length discrepancy. However, the high probability of false alarms in the short run can damage operator confidence in the alarm chart's validity. The IC ARL shows considerable fluctuation in pattern sizes, and a weighted likelihood ratio test is incorporated into the EWMA control chart, enabling the automatic integration of varying sizes. This EWMA scheme is rapid, easy to construct, and highly effective in identifying changes in the Poisson rate. Its robustness in handling pattern size variations makes it a dependable control chart for health surveillance and mortality analysis in Mexico.

1. The application at hand involves tracking the incidence rate, utilizing a Poisson distribution, and adapting to varying sizes over time. A coupled cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart are employed to address the dynamic nature of the data. This approach takes into account the varying sizes and is argued to perform better than the average run length (ARL). The ARL of the chart is found to be appealing yet somewhat unsatisfactory, as it specifies the control limits with an elevated probability of false alarms in the short run, which can negatively impact the operator's confidence in valid alarms. The EWMA control chart, based on the specified control limits, exhibits considerable variation in the pattern size, which is weighted by the likelihood ratio test. This EWMA scheme is fast to compute and easy to construct, proving to be quite efficient in detecting changes in the Poisson rate.
