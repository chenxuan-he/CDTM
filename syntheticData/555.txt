We also consider the correction of covariance matrices for non-Gaussian data, leading to the development of a pseudo likelihood ratio test that maintains its validity. By utilizing non-parametric maximum pseudo likelihood estimation, we highlight its asymptotic finite properties through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, providing a powerful tool for analysis in high dimensions.
