2. We propose a novel approach to conditional quantile regression that incorporates a lack-of-fit test, allowing for the examination of model assumptions in high-dimensional settings. This approach successfully maintains the power of the test while controlling the size, making it a valuable tool for practitioners.

3. In this work, we explore the use of a low-dimensional test for lack of fit in parametric quantile regression models. By applying this test, we are able to check the equality of conditional distributions and make accurate predictions in high-dimensional scenarios, where traditional methods may fail.

4. We investigate the effectiveness of applying a lack-of-fit test in high-dimensional quantile regression models. By constructing a test that explicitly accounts for the critical values, we are able to maintain power while controlling the size of the test. This method is particularly useful in high-dimensional settings where traditional tests may not be reliable.

5. Our research demonstrates the usefulness of examining the lack of fit in low and high dimensional quantile regression models. By applying a novel test that is finite and directly calculated, we are able to effectively check for lack of fit in both low and high dimensional data, providing valuable insights into the performance of the models.

1. This study introduces a novel transformation method for fitting parametric quantile regression models, effectively addressing the issue of lack of fit in high-dimensional data. By conditional application of this transformation, we have successfully tested the lack of fit and established its utility in various scenarios.

2. We propose a low-dimensional quantile regression test that maintains high power while exceeding the size constraints typically associated with high-dimensional tests. This test is explicitly critical and can be directly calculated in finite samples, making it a valuable tool for researchers.

3. The low-dimensional test presented here outperforms traditional high-dimensional tests, as it effectively checks for lack of fit in both low and high-dimensional quantile regression models. This test is particularly useful when dealing with moderate-dimensional data, where the power is maintained while critical values are calculated explicitly.

4. In this work, we investigate the usefulness of an innovative test for lack of fit in parametric quantile regression models. By applying this test in various conditions, we demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying lack of fit, particularly in high-dimensional settings where traditional tests may fail.

5. Our research explores the application of a novel transformation in testing the lack of fit in parametric quantile regression models. This transformation is conditional, ensuring that the test maintains its power even in high-dimensional scenarios, while also being explicit in its critical calculation for finite samples.
