This methodology allows for the estimation of the conditional quantiles of the response variable, taking into account the censoring mechanism. By incorporating the censoring level into the loss function, quantile regression provides a robust framework for analyzing censored data.

Paragraph 3:
Conditional quantile regression is a powerful tool for analyzing censored data, as it takes into account the censoring mechanism and provides a comprehensive framework for estimating the conditional quantiles of the response variable. This approach is particularly advantageous when dealing with survival data, where the event time is often censored due to the limited follow-up period.

Paragraph 4:
The use of conditional quantile regression in the context of censored data has led to the development of various modeling techniques, including parametric, semiparametric, and nonparametric methods. These methods provide flexibility in modeling the relationship between the explanatory variables and the conditional quantiles of the response variable, allowing for a more accurate estimation of the censored data.

Paragraph 5:
The theoretical properties of conditional quantile regression, such as consistency and asymptotic normality, have been well-established in the literature. Additionally, numerical methods, such as the bootstrap, have been developed to improve the inferential properties of the estimators. The application of conditional quantile regression extends beyond censored data, as it can also be used to analyze other types of complex data structures.
