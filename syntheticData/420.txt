1. This study presents a novel approach to the problem of high-dimensional inference, utilizing artificial data to approximate the log-empirical likelihood ratio test. The method overcomes the challenges posed by singular covariance matrices and breakdowns in traditional sandwich approximations, offering a low-cost alternative with high computational efficiency. The technique is particularly effective in testing for violations of regularity assumptions in the presence of missing data, where the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm provides a robust alternative to the frequentist likelihood approach.

2. In the context of missing data mechanisms, we explore a Bayesian direct likelihood framework that ensures the validity of statistical tests, even when the missing data are arbitrarily random. By focusing on diagnostic indicators of misspecification, we emphasize the importance of careful sensitivity analyses in randomized clinical trials, where treatment effects are often inferred from costly surrogate markers.

3. We propose a multiply robust method for estimating the proportion of treatment effect, which combines multiple candidate models and adapts to various sources of ignorable missingness. This approach offers a robust advantage over traditional doubly robust methods, ensuring that the inferred proportion of treatment effect is free from bias due to misspecification. The method is particularly useful in nonparametric settings, where the identification of transformations that center the proportion of treatment effect explained is of great importance.

4. The fused lasso technique, along with its theoretical properties and practical advantages, is investigated as a tool for high-dimensional regression. By incorporating grouped eigenvalues and nonsmooth penalties, the fused lasso provides a flexible and robust alternative to traditional parametric methods. We compare its performance to the nearest neighbour fused lasso, highlighting the inherit adaptivity of both methods in nonparametric regression contexts.

5. In the analysis of multivariate missing data, we consider a new class of sandwich approximations that account for the convex hull of the empirical likelihood. These approximations extend the coverage of the true parameter estimates and offer a significant improvement over traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the use of the empirical likelihood ratio test in the presence of high-dimensional vector powers, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in empirical stock analysis.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood estimation, the challenge lies in the high probability of convex hull failure, leading to a breakdown of the sandwich approximation for the log empirical likelihood ratio test. To address this issue, a new strategy incorporating artificial data is proposed, which adds an asymptotic normality property to the empirical likelihood ratio test. This test is characterized by its ease of implementation and low computational cost, as well as its superior performance in high-dimensional vector power empirical stock analysis.

2. In the context of multivariate missing data, the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm offers a robust alternative to the frequentist likelihood paradigm. While the former assumes a missing at random mechanism, the latter demands a fully specified missing mechanism. Statistical tests conducted under these paradigms often indicate violations of assumptions, prompting cautious statisticians to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses.

3. In randomized clinical trials, the use of surrogate markers to infer treatment effects is of great importance. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained by these markers can yield biased results due to misspecification. Nonparametric methods ensure a strong violation of the assumptions, while the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm provides sufficient evidence to encourage careful specification and sensitivity analyses.

4. The concept of multiple robustness in the context of doubly robust methods is somewhat surprising, as it permits consistent estimation of multiple candidate propensity score outcome regression models. This property, termed multiple robustness, is particularly advantageous in settings where there is ignorable missingness and multiple robustness is achieved through a combination of doubly robust methods and adaptive mixing.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation techniques, such as the lasso and the fused lasso, have gained popularity in nonparametric regression. These methods inherit local adaptivity from the nearest neighbour graph, which is computed using a regular grid. The fused lasso, which occurs in regular grids, offers a theoretical advantage over the nearest neighbour graph, leading to excellent completeness properties and a more robust approach to regression analysis.

1. This study presents a novel approach to addressing the challenge of high-dimensional vector empirical likelihood ratio tests. By incorporating artificial data, we aim to achieve asymptotic normality in the empirical likelihood ratio statistics. Our strategy overcomes the limitations of traditional methods, such as the singular breakdown of covariance matrices and the high computational cost associated with inverting the covariance matrix explicitly. Furthermore, our approach enjoys a low-dimensional focus, making it particularly suitable for empirical stock analysis in high-dimensional spaces.

2. In the context of missing data mechanisms in Bayesian direct likelihood paradigms, we explore the frequentist likelihood paradigm's demand for missing mechanisms that always produce missing data randomly. We emphasize the importance of testing for this assumption, as it is crucial for the validity of statistical inferences. Our analysis encourages statisticians to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses to ensure the validity of Bayesian direct likelihood results, especially in the case of randomized clinical trials with expensive long-term follow-ups.

3. We investigate the problem of inferring treatment effects from surrogate markers in randomized clinical trials. The identification of the proportion of treatment effect explained (PTE) is of great importance, as quantifying this proportion can yield unbiased estimates. We propose a nonparametric approach that ensures the PTE falls within a specified range, thus providing a robust alternative to traditional parametric methods.

4. Multiply robust methods offer a significant advantage in the analysis of ignorable missingness in multiply robust settings. By combining multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, we achieve consistency in the estimation of the treatment effect. The property of multiple robustness, which ensures valid inferences even when certain components of the model are misspecified, is particularly valuable in practice. We term this property "multiple robustness" and demonstrate its superior performance compared to traditional doubly robust methods.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation techniques, such as the lasso and fused lasso, have gained popularity in nonparametric regression. These methods offer theoretical advantages over competing approaches, inheriting local adaptivity from the nearest neighbour graph and manifold adaptivity from the fused lasso. The fused lasso, in particular, is well-suited for denoising and can be extended to the locally adaptive regular grid. We discuss the computational benefits of these methods and their numerical comparison with other robust regression techniques.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood estimation, the challenge lies in the high probability that the convex hull does not encompass the true parameter space. This issue is compounded by the singularity of the covariance matrix, which leads to a breakdown in sandwich approximations. To address this, a new strategy involving artificial data is proposed to add asymptotic normality to the log empirical likelihood ratio test. This test, which explicitly involves the inverse covariance matrix, is easy to implement and computationally efficient, outperforming traditional tests in high-dimensional vector spaces.

2. The analysis of multivariate missing data presents a significant challenge due to an unassessable mechanism that creates missing information. In contrast to the frequentist likelihood paradigm, which always assumes a missing mechanism that produces missing data at random, the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm offers a more flexible approach. However, it is crucial to ensure that the missing data are indeed missing at random to maintain the validity of the Bayesian analysis. Statisticians must exercise caution and conduct targeted sensitivity analyses to verify this assumption.

3. In the context of randomized clinical trials, primary outcomes are often long-term and costly to follow, making surrogate markers desirable for inferring treatment effects. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained is of great importance, as biased misspecification can yield incorrect inferences. Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the estimation, especially when the relationship between the treatment effect and the outcome is nonlinear. Appropriate transformations can be identified to optimize the estimation, ensuring that the proportion of treatment effect explained is inferred correctly.

4. Multiply robust methods offer a robust advantage over traditional doubly robust approaches by allowing multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models. This consistency in multiple correctly specified models is termed multiple robustness. Surprisingly, multiply robust methods can be achieved by adaptively mixing multiple candidate models, ensuring both robustness and efficiency. Theoretical properties of these methods are confined to parametric models, with numerical comparisons demonstrating their superior performance.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation has gained popularity, with nonsmooth penalties such as the Lasso and the fused Lasso proving particularly useful. The Lasso and the fused Lasso, which involve computing the nearest neighbour graph, offer theoretical advantages over competing methods. They inherit local adaptivity from the nearest neighbour approach and manifest adaptivity in manifold spaces. The fused Lasso, in particular, occurs as a regular grid leading nonparametric regression, known as the nearest neighbour fused Lasso. This method computational efficiency and excellent completeness properties, setting it apart from the nearest neighbour graph approach.

Paragraph 1:
The issue at hand involves the empirical likelihood method, which falls short in high-dimensional scenarios where the covariance matrix becomes singular, leading to a breakdown in the sandwich approximation. To tackle this challenge, a new strategy incorporates artificial data to asymptotically recover the normality of the log-empirical likelihood ratio, simplifying the test while maintaining low computational costs. This approach outperforms traditional tests in high-dimensional settings and is particularly useful for empirical stock analysis.

Paragraph 2:
Within the realm of missing data mechanisms, the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm offers an alternative to the frequentist likelihood approach, which always assumes a missing at random mechanism. This assumption is crucial for ensuring the validity of tests, as it assumes that the missing data are randomly distributed. However, violations of this assumption can lead statisticians to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses to ensure the reliability of their findings.

Paragraph 3:
In randomized clinical trials, surrogate markers can serve as a valuable proxy for the primary outcome, especially when long-term follow-up is costly or not feasible. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained by these markers is of great importance. However, without careful consideration, such quantification can yield biased results due to misspecification. Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the estimated proportion, especially when the relationship with the outcome is nonlinear.

Paragraph 4:
Adopting a multiply robust approach offers several advantages over traditional doubly robust methods in the context of handling ignorable missingness. This approach not only provides robustness but also permits multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, ensuring consistency and correctly specified models. This multiply robust property, termed "multiple robustness," is particularly beneficial when combining multiple models to improve specification and achieve asymptotic normality.

Paragraph 5:
When it comes topenalized covariance matrix estimation, the choice of penalty plays a significant role. Non-smooth penalties, such as the Lasso or Elasso, and the fused lasso, which is a total variation denoising technique, offer theoretical advantages over competing methods. These penalties group eigenvalues and promote sparsity, leading to nonparametric regression methods like the nearest neighbour fused lasso. This approach inherits local adaptivity from the fused lasso and manifolds adaptivity from nearest neighbour methods, providing an excellent alternative to traditional nearest neighbour graphs in terms of completeness and flexibility.

Paragraph 1:
The issue at hand involves the empirical likelihood method, which fails in high-dimensional scenarios where the covariance matrix becomes singular. This breakdown necessitates a new strategy, such as adding artificial variables to restore convexity. The challenge lies in approximating the log-empirical likelihood ratio, which is crucial for testing. This approach offers a low computational cost alternative to traditional tests and outperforms them in high-dimensional settings.

Paragraph 2:
In the realm of multivariate missing data, a strong and unassessable mechanism can lead to ignorable fold dependency. Focusing on the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm, the missing data mechanism is assumed to always produce random missing, which is regularly tested. However, it is necessary to ensure the validity of this paradigm by accounting for the missing indicator. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to detect any violations of this assumption.

Paragraph 3:
Randomized clinical trials often involve primary outcomes that are long-term and costly, making surrogate markers desirable for inferring treatment effects. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained is of great importance, but this can yield biased results due to misspecification. Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the inferred proportion, especially when it nonlinearly relates to the outcome.

Paragraph 4:
Multiply robust methods offer a robust advantage over traditional doubly robust approaches by allowing multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models. This consistency in multiple correctly specified models is termed multiple robustness. Surprisingly, these methods can improve model specification and achieve asymptotic normality through adaptive mixing.

Paragraph 5:
The choice of penalty in penalized covariance matrix estimation is crucial. Non-smooth penalties, such as the Lasso or Elasso, fused lasso, and total variation denoising, locally adaptive regular grids, offer theoretical advantages over competing methods. These methods inherit local adaptivity from the fused lasso and manifold adaptivity from nearest neighbour methods, making them particularly useful in nonparametric regression.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood estimation, the challenge lies in the high probability convex hull not satisfying the true covariance matrix, leading to breakdowns in sandwich approximations. To address this, a new strategy incorporating artificial data is proposed, which adds asymptotic normality to the log empirical likelihood ratio test. This test, involving the inverse covariance matrix, is explicit and easily implemented with low computational costs, numerically outperforming traditional tests in high-dimensional vector analysis.

2. Analyzing multivariate data with missing values requires a strong and unassessable mechanism, as the frequentist likelihood paradigm demands a missing mechanism that always produces missing randomness. In contrast, the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm assumes missing data as always random, and when tested alone, it indicates potential incorrect assumptions. Therefore, ensuring validity often necessitates a Bayesian direct likelihood approach, along with targeted sensitivity analyses in randomized clinical trials where primary outcomes are long-followed and costly surrogate markers are desired.

3. Inferring treatment effects from proportional effects explained is of great importance. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect yielded by biased misspecifications in nonparametric models ensures that the inference is valid. Specifically, identifying transformations that nonlinearly relate to the proportion of treatment effect explained is crucial. This is especially pertinent in the context of opt-center dot, where the proportion of treatment effect explained is inferred, ensuring finite randomized effects in HIV patient responses.

4. Multiply robust methods, which offer both robustness and traditional doubly robust properties, are particularly advantageous in settings with ignorable missingness. These methods permit multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, ensuring consistency and correctly specified properties. Termed "multiple robustness," this approach is somewhat surprisingly more powerful than doubly robust methods, especially when combining multiple candidates and adapting mixing parameters.

5. The use of penalized covariance matrix choices, such as nonsmooth penalties like the Lasso or the fused lasso, has theoretical advantages over competing methods. The fused lasso, Total Variation Denoising, and locally adaptive regular grids are examples of nonparametric regression methods that inherit local adaptivity from the nearest neighbor fused lasso. This connection allows for excellent completeness properties, particularly when contrasted with the nearest neighbor graph, which is often used in applications like flu surveillance.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood methods, the challenge lies in the high probability convex hull not providing a true cover, leading to singular breakdowns in the covariance matrix. To address this, a new strategy incorporates artificial data to achieve asymptotic normality in the log empirical likelihood ratio test. This test, involving the inverse covariance matrix, offers explicit testing with low computational costs and outperforms traditional tests in high-dimensional vector analysis.

2. Within the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm, the presence of missing data is handled differently from the frequentist likelihood paradigm. Here, the missing data mechanism is assumed to always produce random missing, and diagnostic tests are conducted to ensure the validity of the analysis. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to detect any violations of this assumption.

3. In the context of randomized clinical trials, long-term follow-up can be costly and surrogate markers are often used to infer treatment effects. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained is crucial, but this can yield biased results due to misspecification. Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the proportion treatment effect range, particularly when approximate methods, which may relate nonlinearly to the true transformation, are used.

4. Multiply robust methods offer advantages over traditional doubly robust approaches in the presence of ignorable missingness. These methods permit multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, ensuring consistency and correctly specified properties. This multiply robustness, achieved through adaptively mixing multiple candidates, outperforms doubly robust methods and achieves asymptotic normality without relying on parametric assumptions.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation, such as through the use of nonsmooth penalties like the Lasso or fused lasso, has led to innovative nonparametric regression methods. The fused lasso, for instance, is a combination of the Lasso and total variation denoising, offering theoretical advantages over competing methods. Its local adaptivity, inherited from the nearest neighbour graph approach, allows for excellent completeness and flexibility in graphical representations, setting it apart from traditional nearest neighbour methods.

Our method demonstrates improved performance over traditional tests and offers a promising alternative for high-dimensional data analysis.

3. We investigate a novel diagnostic test for identifying incorrectly specified models in empirical likelihood analysis. The test is based on the violation of Bayesian direct likelihood assumptions and provides a targeted sensitivity analysis for random missing data mechanisms. This diagnostic tool is valuable for ensuring the validity of statistical inferences and encouraging careful conduct of targeted sensitivity analyses in the presence of missing data.

4. In the field of nonparametric regression, we introduce a method for estimating the proportion of treatment effect explained in randomized clinical trials. This method accounts for the presence of surrogate markers and yields unbiased estimates of the treatment effect, even when the outcome is missing. By approximating the relationship between the treatment effect and the outcome, our approach offers a flexible and robust alternative to traditional parametric methods.

5. We explore a multiple robustness approach to doubly robust estimation in the presence of ignorable missingness in multiply robust regression models. This method combines multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, ensuring consistent estimation even when the specification of the models is uncertain. By adapting the mixing of multiple candidate models, we achieve both doubly robustness and asymptotic normality, providing a theoretically grounded and numerically competitive solution for robust estimation in high-dimensional data analysis.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood estimation, the size of the dataset plays a crucial role in satisfying the elements of infinity. Tsao's empirical likelihood method fails when the probability of convex hull coverage is high, leading to a breakdown of the sandwich approximation. Addressing this challenge, a new strategy involves adding an artificial term to achieve asymptotic normality for the log-empirical likelihood ratio test. This test, which involves the inverse of the covariance matrix, is explicit and easily implemented with low computational costs, as demonstrated by numerical comparisons.

2. In the analysis of multivariate missing data, a strong and unassessable mechanism creates missing information that can be ignored under certain conditions. The Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm offers a contrast to the frequentist likelihood paradigm, which always assumes a missing mechanism that produces missing data randomly. While the Bayesian approach encourages careful statisticians to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses, it is necessary to ensure the validity of the results when the missing mechanism is always random.

3. In the context of randomized clinical trials, the primary outcome is often a long-term follow-up that is both costly and desirable. A surrogate marker can be used to infer the treatment effect, which is of great importance in quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained. However, failing to quantify this proportion can lead to biased misspecification and nonparametric methods may not always ensure the validity of the inferred proportion.

4. The concept of multiple robustness in statistics refers to a property that ensures consistent results across multiple candidate models. This property, termed "multiple robustness," is somewhat surprising as it combines the strengths of both doubly robust methods and traditional approaches. It allows for the improvement of model specification by adaptively mixing multiple candidate models, achieving asymptotic normality and superior performance in numerical comparisons.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation has gained popularity in recent years, with the choice of penalty being a crucial aspect of the method. Non-smooth penalties, such as the Lasso or the Elasso, and fused lasso methods offer advantages in terms of adaptivity and theoretical properties. These methods, which include total variation denoising and locally adaptive regular grids, have outperformed traditional doubly robust methods in numerical comparisons, demonstrating their superiority in nonparametric regression.

These strategies involve adding artificial variables to approximate the log-empirical likelihood ratio test, which addresses the issue of singular covariance matrices and breakdowns in sandwich approximations. This approach offers a low computational cost alternative with promising numerical comparisons, particularly in the context of multivariate missing data analysis.

2. The Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm offers a solution to the problem of missing data mechanisms that are often ignored in frequentist likelihood approaches. This paradigm assumes that missing data are randomly generated and tests this assumption separately, ensuring the validity of statistical inferences. Sensitivity analyses are encouraged to detect any violations of this assumption, which is crucial for the validity of Bayesian direct likelihood results.

3. In the analysis of randomized clinical trials, surrogate markers are often used as a means to infer treatment effects when direct measurement of the primary outcome is lengthy or costly.

Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the inference when the relationship between the surrogate marker and the treatment effect is nonlinear and complex.

4. Multiple robustness is a property that extends the concept of doubly robust methods, which are traditionally used in the context of ignorable missingness. This property allows for consistent estimation of multiple regression coefficients when multiple candidate propensity scores and outcomes are considered. It ensures that the specification of the model is correctly specified and termed multiple robustness. This approach outperforms traditional doubly robust methods and achieves asymptotic normality through a combination of multiple candidates, adaptively mixing them to improve the specification.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation has gained popularity in the field of nonparametric regression. Methods such as the Elastic Net, Fused Lasso, and Total Variation Denoising offer advantages in terms of adaptivity and theoretical properties. These methods inherit the local adaptivity of the nearest neighbour approach while also incorporating grouped regularization, as seen in the Lasso and Group Lasso. The Fused Lasso, in particular, is related to the manifold adaptivity of the nearest neighbour graph, which is a powerful tool for nonparametric regression with excellent completeness properties.

1. In the realm of empirical likelihood estimation, the challenge lies in the high probability convex hull not encompassing the true parameter space, leading to singular breakdowns in the covariance matrix. To address this, a novel strategy involves adding artificial variables to achieve asymptotic normality for the log-empirical likelihood ratio test. This test, which explicitly involves the inverse covariance matrix, is computationally efficient and easy to implement, outperforming traditional tests in high-dimensional settings.

2. The analysis of multivariate missing data necessitates a strong and unassessable mechanism, which creates a missing-ignorable fold-dependent mode. Focusing on the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm, the missing data mechanism is explored in contrast to the frequentist likelihood paradigm, which always assumes missing at random. When tested independently, the missing indicator fully captures the diagnostic test's indication of incorrect likelihoods, highlighting the importance of ensuring the validity of the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm.

3. In randomized clinical trials, the long-term follow-up and costly primary outcomes make surrogate markers a desirable alternative for inferring treatment effects. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained is of great importance, as it yields unbiased estimators and ensures the validity of the nonparametric approach. Furthermore, approximate methods, particularly those related nonlinearly, are essential for identifying transformations that optimize the inferred proportion of treatment effect explained.

Penalized covariance matrix estimation techniques, such as the lasso, fused lasso, and total variation denoising, locally adaptive regular grids, offer theoretical advantages over competing methods. The fused lasso, in particular, inherits local adaptivity from the nearest neighbour approach, while also incorporating manifold adaptivity. This combination results in excellent completeness and provides a robust alternative to the nearest neighbour graph, particularly in contrast to the nearest neighbour fused lasso method.

1. This study presents a novel approach to addressing the challenge of high-dimensional vector empirical likelihood ratio tests. By incorporating artificial data, we aim to establish an asymptotic normality approximation for the log empirical likelihood ratio, which simplifies the computation and lowers the cost. This strategy outperforms traditional tests in terms of numerical comparison and offers a more straightforward test involving the inverse covariance matrix.

Careful statisticians should thus conduct targeted sensitivity analyses to ensure the validity of their findings.

3. In randomized clinical trials, the use of a surrogate marker to infer treatment effects is a common practice, especially when the primary outcome is long-term and costly to measure. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained by the surrogate marker is of great importance. However, failing to account for biased misspecification can lead to yielding a biased estimate. Nonparametric methods ensure the validity of the inference when the proportion of treatment effect explained is within a certain range, and they can approximate the nonlinear relationship between the marker and the effect.

4. The concept of multiple robustness in statistics refers to a property that ensures consistent inference across multiple candidate models. This is particularly valuable in the context of doubly robust methods, which combine multiple models to improve specification and enhance the robustness of the inference. The fused lasso, a penalized covariance matrix estimation technique, is an example of a method that achieves multiple robustness. It combines the local adaptivity of the nearest neighbour graph with the global adaptivity of the fused lasso, leading to improved theoretical properties and numerical performance.

5. The fused lasso, also known as the Elasso method, is a powerful tool in nonparametric regression. It combines the Total Variation Denoising and the locally adaptive regular grid methods, inheriting the local adaptivity of the nearest neighbour approach.

This paradigm assumes that the missing data mechanism is missing at random, and we provide sufficient evidence to support this assumption. We also discuss the importance of conducting targeted sensitivity analyses to ensure the validity of the results.

3. The problem of biased estimation in nonparametric models due to the presence of ignorable missing data is addressed. We propose a new method for quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained by the observed data, which is based on the nonparametric bootstrap. This method ensures that the estimation is valid even when the missing data mechanism is ignorable.

4. We investigate a novel multiply robust approach for analyzing randomized clinical trials with surrogate markers as the primary outcome. This method allows for the identification and quantification of the proportion of treatment effect explained, ensuring that the estimation is not biased by misspecification. We also provide theoretical support for the finite sample properties of this approach.

5. The concept of multiple robustness is introduced, which combines multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models in a doubly robust manner. This approach not only improves the specification of the models but also achieves asymptotic normality when mixing doubly robust estimators. We compare this method with the traditional multiply robust approach and show that it outperforms the latter in terms of numerical properties.

Paragraph 1:
The issue at hand involves the empirical likelihood method, which fails in high-dimensional scenarios where the covariance matrix becomes singular. To address this, a new strategy incorporates artificial data to approximate the log-empirical likelihood ratio test. This approach offers a low-cost, easy-to-use test that outperforms traditional methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

Paragraph 2:
In the realm of multivariate analysis, missing data mechanisms often pose significant challenges. The Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm presents a novel approach to handling missing data, contrasting with the frequentist likelihood paradigm's constant demand for missing mechanisms. While the former assumes missing data to be random, the后者 never ensures the validity of this assumption. Therefore, diagnostic tests are essential to identify potential issues, and sensitivity analyses should be conducted meticulously by statisticians.

Paragraph 3:
Randomized clinical trials frequently employ surrogate markers to infer treatment effects when direct measurement of the primary outcome is lengthy or costly. Quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained is crucial, yet this estimation can be prone to bias due to misspecification. Nonparametric methods ensure robustness against such issues, particularly when the relationship between the marker and the treatment effect is nonlinear.

Paragraph 4:
For HIV patients, monitoring treatment responses is vital, and the presence of ignorable missingness in multiple outcomes can provide a robust advantage. Traditional doubly robust methods, which combine multiple candidate propensity score models and outcome regressions, offer consistency but may require careful specification. The concept of multiple robustness, characterized by both doubly robust and adaptively mixed models, has emerged as a promising alternative. This approach achieves asymptotic normality and outperforms traditional methods in terms of numerical comparability.

Paragraph 5:
In the realm of covariance matrix estimation, penalized methods have gained prominence. The choice of penalty is crucial, with nonsmooth penalties like the Lasso and Elastic-Net proving effective. The fused lasso, total variation denoising, and locally adaptive regular grids are examples of methods that arise from this penalized framework. These approaches inherit the local adaptivity of the nearest neighbour method while also incorporating the advantages of nonparametric regression. The fused lasso, in particular, stands out for its theoretical properties and competitive performance in high-dimensional settings.

1. This study introduces a novel approach to estimating the parameters of a statistical model using artificial data, which addresses the challenge of high-dimensionality in empirical likelihood ratio tests. The method overcomes the breakdown of conventional sandwich approximations and singular covariance matrices by focusing on the convex hull of the empirical likelihood. The added artificial data help to ensure the asymptotic normality of the empirical likelihood ratio test, which is crucial for its validity. This strategy significantly reduces computational costs and offers a straightforward test that is easily carried out, making it particularly useful for analyzing multivariate data with strong unassessable mechanisms causing missing values.

2. In the context of missing data mechanisms, the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm presents a significant departure from the frequentist likelihood paradigm. While the former assumes that missing data are missing at random, the latter always requires a missing mechanism that produces missing data randomly. When tested alone, the missing indicator approach fails to diagnose incorrect assumptions about the missing data mechanism, which can lead to invalid conclusions. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the missing data are indeed missing at random to maintain the validity of the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm. This study encourages statisticians to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses to investigate potential violations of this assumption.

3. In randomized clinical trials, the use of a surrogate marker to infer the treatment effect has become increasingly important due to the long follow-up periods and high costs associated with primary outcomes. Quantifying the proportion of the treatment effect explained by the surrogate marker is of great importance. However, traditional methods can yield biased results due to misspecification, especially when the relationship between the marker and the treatment effect is nonlinear. This study proposes a nonparametric approach that ensures the validity of the inference by quantifying the proportion of the treatment effect within a specified range, thereby addressing the issue of biased misspecification.

4. The problem of ignorable missingness in the context of multiply robust estimation has been a long-standing challenge in statistical analysis. Traditional doubly robust methods, which combine multiple candidate propensity scores and outcome regressions, have been unable to consistently identify the correct specification. However, a new approach termed "multiple robustness" offers a solution to this problem. By adaptively mixing multiple candidate models, multiple robustness achieves asymptotic normality and outperforms traditional doubly robust methods. Moreover, the theoretical properties of multiple robustness are confined to parametric models, making it numerically comparable and superior to multiply robust methods.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation has gained popularity in the field of nonparametric regression. The use of nonsmooth penalties, such as the lasso, fused lasso, and total variation denoising, has led to significant advancements in the estimation of complex models. These methods inherit the local adaptivity of the nearest neighbor regression approach, allowing for the efficient computation of the nearest neighbor graph. The fused lasso, in particular, has been shown to outperform the nearest neighbor method by leveraging both local adaptivity and manifold adaptivity. This theoretical advantage is further confirmed in numerical comparisons, demonstrating the excellent completeness and performance of the fused lasso in various applications, including the analysis of HIV patient responses.

1. This study presents a novel approach to estimating the parameters of a statistical model using empirical likelihood, which is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data. The method overcomes the limitations of traditional likelihood-based methods that often fail in high-dimensional settings. By employing a sandwich approximation and a new strategy for adding artificial data, we establish the asymptotic normality of the empirical likelihood ratio test. This test offers a powerful tool for hypothesis testing with low computational cost and easy implementation.

2. In the context of multivariate missing data, we compare the Bayesian direct likelihood paradigm with the frequentist likelihood paradigm. While the frequentist paradigm assumes a missing mechanism that always produces missing data randomly, the Bayesian paradigm allows for more flexibility. We propose a diagnostic test to identify cases where the missing data assumption may be violated, ensuring the validity of the analysis.

3. In randomized clinical trials, surrogate markers are often used as a proxy for the primary outcome due to the long follow-up and high cost. We investigate methods for inferring the treatment effect from these markers, emphasizing the importance of quantifying the proportion of treatment effect explained. We develop a nonparametric approach that ensures the validity of the inference, even when the relationship between the marker and the outcome is nonlinear.

4. We explore the concept of multiple robustness in the context of doubly robust methods for estimating treatment effects. These methods combine multiple candidate propensity score and outcome regression models, providing robustness against misspecification. We show that under certain conditions, these methods achieve asymptotic normality and outperform traditional doubly robust methods in terms of specification consistency.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation is a popular technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. We compare the fused lasso, which is a grouping of eigenvalues, with the elasso and total variation denoising methods. The fused lasso offers theoretical advantages over these methods, inheriting local adaptivity from the nearest neighbour approach. We demonstrate the superior performance of the fused lasso in terms of numerical comparability and outperforming competing methods.

1. This study presents a novel approach to address the challenge of high-dimensional vector data analysis, specifically in the context of empirical likelihood ratio tests. The method introduces artificial data to asymptotically normalize the log empirical likelihood ratio, enhancing the robustness of the test. This strategy not only overcomes the breakdown of conventional sandwich approximations but also significantly reduces computational costs. A comparison with traditional tests demonstrates the superior performance in terms of low bias and high accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios.

2. In the realm of Bayesian statistics, the direct likelihood paradigm faces limitations when dealing with missing data mechanisms that are not always random. This paper highlights the importance of accounting for missingness in a manner that ensures the validity of statistical inferences. We propose a diagnostic test to identify instances of incorrectly assumed random missingness and encourage practitioners to conduct targeted sensitivity analyses. Our approach offers a comprehensive framework for robust estimation in the presence of missing data, even in the costly anddesirable scenario of long follow-up in randomized clinical trials.

3. The quantification of the proportion of treatment effect explained (PTEE) is a critical measure in evaluating the efficacy of interventions. Traditional methods that rely on parametric assumptions may yield biased estimates, potentially leading to misspecification. This paper advocates for nonparametric approaches that ensure the validity of PTEE inferences, particularly when the relationship between treatment and outcome is nonlinear. We propose a transformation that optimally centers the PTEE, facilitating accurate estimation and robust inference.

4. Multiply robust methods enjoy a distinct advantage in the analysis of ignorable missingness, where the presence of multiple candidate propensity scores and outcome regressions allows for consistent and correctly specified models. This robustness property, termed "multiple robustness," is somewhat surprisingly achieved through the combination of doubly robust methods. We explore the benefits of adaptively mixing multiple candidate models, demonstrating improved model specification and doubly robust inference. Theoretical properties and numerical comparisons confirm the superior performance of this multiply robust approach.

5. Penalized covariance matrix estimation has gained prominence in the field of nonparametric regression, offering a flexible framework for dealing with complex data structures. This paper discusses the advantages of using nonsmooth penalties, such as the Lasso or fused Lasso, in the context of grouped eigenvalues and manifold adaptivity. We compare the performance of the fused Lasso with the nearest neighbor approach, highlighting the theoretical advantages of the former in terms of adaptivity and completeness. The fused Lasso emerges as a powerful tool for denoising and total variation estimation, particularly when dealing with locally adaptive regular grids.
