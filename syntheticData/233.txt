Paragraph [test] examines the suitability of family parametric and nonparametric tests for formally checking the bias of a vector residual. The traditional diagnostic tool, the residual plot, is used to examine the rate at which contiguous residuals are detected consistently. The Adaptive Neyman test is a powerful omnibus power test that compares favorably to conventional tests. It is suitable for applications in partially linear models and offers a thorough test. In contrast, the conventional neural network and the stochastic neural network are both used to approximate complex nonlinear stochastic systems, but the stochastic neural network offers a more efficient scheme with much lower computational complexity. It enables the carry selection based on the Bayesian criterion, allowing the choice of hidden units using both input and output. The stochastic neural network has the universal approximation property and fits the simulated time series data well, improving post-forecast fits. In contrast, conventional neural networks are nonlinear nonparametric models that lack the ability to select hidden units based on the error term, making them computationally expensive and ignoring the stochastic error in the selection process. Penalized likelihood methods handle high-dimensional modeling with nonparametric regression, offering stepwise selection that is computationally feasible. They select coefficients simultaneously while satisfying the continuity requirement, enabling the construction of confidence intervals. Penalty functions are chosen to produce sparse solutions, reducing bias and satisfying the continuity condition. Algorithms that optimize penalized likelihood are readily applicable to a variety of parametric and generalized linear models, robust regression, and nonparametric modeling. Wavelet spline methods offer rate convergence with proper choice of regularization, performing oracle selection, namely selecting the correct submodel. This newly favored selection technique is error-free and accurately tested, making it a practical application in various fields.
