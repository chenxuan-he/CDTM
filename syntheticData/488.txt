1. In this study, we propose a nonparametric approach to least squares regression using deep neural networks, providing a nonasymptotic upper bound on the excess risk. Our method employs an empirical risk minimizer with a feedforward architecture, achieving a minimax rate for deep neural regression error bounds. This contrasts with existing approaches that polynomially increase the dimension of the predictor, instead opting to circumvent the curse of dimensionality by approximating a low-dimensional manifold with low Minkowski dimension. Our approach offers an optimal convergence rate when the predictor is supported by an exact manifold, which we investigate in the context of prediction error for neural regression.

2. We investigate the structure of neural networks and provide a quantitative evaluation of their relative efficiency. Our analysis reveals that the prediction error for neural regression can be approximated by a family of eigenvalue covariance matrices in the ultrahigh-dimensional setting. This allows us to conduct covariance matrix tests in an ultrahigh-dimensional context, leveraging the independence of matrix-valued white noise experiments. By conducting extensive investigations into the finite property of asymptotic normality and eigenvalue testing, we uncover structural matrix variates that routinely arise in diverse fields.

3. The multilayer network structure has been extensively investigated for brain image clustering, delivering fruitful outcomes. We address fundamental questions such as optimality and computational limits in low-rank matrix recovery, assuming a matrix-valued planted low-rank structure. Our study provides a minimax lower bound for low-rank matrix recovery, allowing for a range of signal strengths. We demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator is computationally infeasible when the signal is too strong, highlighting a computational limit. We propose a computationally fast spectral aggregation method that achieves minimax optimality, and our numerical experiments confirm the theoretical showcase of its merit.

4. We analyze the singular matrix \( X \) with columns \( X_{nj} \) as independent dimensional vectors, possibly assuming a covariance matrix \( \EN{X_{nj}}{j=1}^{n} \). These vectors are asymptotically simultaneously diagonalized, appropriately converging to spectra with a limiting spectral distribution (LSD). The singular vectors \( X_{n} \) grow in dimension to infinity with a magnitude comparable to the matrix \( X \). This extends beyond covariance matrices to weighted and Gram matrices, and we develop an application in linear time that ensures the existence and uniqueness of the LSD realized covariance matrix. Our method is applicable to multi-dimensional diffusion processes with anisotropic time-varying co-volatility and recent matrix-valued auto-regressive models with LSD singular matrices.

5. In the context of correlated graphs, we independently subsample Erdős-Rényi graphs and aim to recover latent vertex matching graphs with label \( \alpha \). We sharpen the constant factor in the sharp theoretical threshold for correctly matching a positive fraction of vertices. Our recent work by Wu, Xu, and Yu investigates the existence of a sharp threshold for recovering the latent graph structure, providing insights into the relative merits of various graph recovery methods.

1. This study presents a nonparametric approach for least squares regression using a deep neural network. It provides a nonasymptotic upper bound on the excess risk and demonstrates that the empirical risk minimizer achieves a minimax rate of convergence. The approach significantly improves existing methods by polynomially reducing the dimension of the predictor, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. The proposed algorithm approximates the low-dimensional manifold on which the predictor lies, supporting an optimal convergence rate with exact manifold support. The investigation explores the prediction error of neural regression structures, evaluating the relative efficiency of neural networks with respect to their approximation error bounds and smooth ReLU activation functions. The study extends these results to ultrahigh-dimensional settings, investigating the asymptotic normality of the family of eigenvalue covariance matrices in the context of testing matrix-valued white noise.

2. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge in high-dimensional regression. This work introduces a property-nonparametric least squares regression method using a deep neural network. The method provides a nonasymptotic upper bound for the excess risk and empirically minimizes the risk. Furthermore, it improves the existing results by polynomially reducing the dimension of the predictor. The proposed approach can approximate the low-dimensional manifold that supports the predictor, achieving an optimal convergence rate with exact manifold support. The research extends these findings to ultrahigh-dimensional settings, where it investigates the eigenvalue covariance matrix tests in the presence of ultrahigh-dimensionality. This study also examines the relative efficiency of neural networks and their structure in approximating the prediction error.

1. In this study, we propose a nonparametric approach to estimate the regression coefficients using a deep neural network. Our method offers a nonasymptotic upper bound on the excess risk of the empirical risk minimizer. Furthermore, we achieve a minimax rate of convergence for the deep neural regression error bound. The key advantage of our approach is that it polynomially reduces the dimension of the predictor, thereby circumventing the curse of dimensionality. By approximating the low-dimensional manifold supported by the predictor, we achieve an optimal convergence rate for the prediction error. We investigate the structure of the neural network and provide a neural network notion that evaluates the relative efficiency of different network structures in terms of approximation error bounds and smooth ReLU activation functions.

2. We explore the prediction error in the context of neural regression and investigate the structural properties of neural networks. By relaxing the assumption of exponentially dimensional predictors, we demonstrate that the low Minkowski dimension of the optimal convergence rate can be achieved. Furthermore, we propose a spectral aggregation method that achieves minimax optimality in the presence of ultrahigh-dimensionality. Our approach allows for a range of signal strengths, overcoming the computational limit associated with low-rank matrix recovery. We conduct numerical experiments to confirm the theoretical results and showcase the merits of spectral aggregation in the context of worldwide food trading.

3. The problem of estimating singular matrices in high dimensions isroutinely encountered in diverse fields. We consider the recovery of low-rank matrices from noise-corrupted measurements and develop a polynomial-time algorithm that consistently recovers the low-rank structure. Our analysis reveals multiple phase transitions in the minimax error rate, indicating a computational gap that is numerically confirmed. Additionally, we study the existence and uniqueness of the least squares solution for a matrix valued auto-regressive model with a latent singular structure. Our results extend to the recovery of graph structures, such as the vertex matching in Erdo-Renyi graphs.

4. We analyze the spectral properties of a class of singular matrices that arise in high-dimensional statistics. Assuming that the columns of the matrix are independent and identically distributed random vectors with an appropriately chosen covariance matrix, we show that the matrix can be asymptotically simultaneously diagonalized. This result has implications for the recovery of multi-dimensional diffusion processes with anisotropic time-varying co-volatility. Furthermore, we extend our findings to the matrix valued auto-regressive model with a latent singular structure and apply our results to the analysis of correlated graphs.

5. In the field of machine learning, the problem of recovering low-rank matrices from high-dimensional data has received significant attention. We propose a novel spectral aggregation method that consistently recovers low-rank matrices in the presence of noise and computational constraints. Our approach is motivated by the sharp theoretical threshold for the recovery of latent vertex matching graphs in the Erdo-Renyi graph model. By relaxing the assumption of independently and identically distributed columns, we extend our results to a wider range of applications, including the recovery of matrix valued auto-regressive models and the analysis of ultrahigh-dimensional data.
