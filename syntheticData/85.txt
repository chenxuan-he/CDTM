In recent years, Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention, particularly due to their ability to decompose complex Bayesian networks into more tractable components. This decomposition has significantly improved the scalability and tractability of Bayesian models, allowing for greater success in a variety of applications. However, the contrast between decomposable and non-decomposable Bayesian models, as well as the use of penalized likelihood methods, has also been a significant area of focus. The scalability of Bayesian models at a higher level has been a major success, despite their strengths, especially in quantifying uncertainty and addressing gaps in scalable and flexible Bayesian models. The selection of Gaussian undirected graphical models and generalized Wishart distributions has also been an area of interest, particularly in the handling of multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs. The development of efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for posterior distribution draws has been a key advancement, enabling the application of generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graph models. These models, which contain both decomposable and substantially larger decomposable graphs, proceed with theoretical properties and improved computational efficiency. The use of the Gibbs sampler in these models has led to significant improvements in scalability, with higher-dimensional models now being more feasible. This scalability has been achieved through the adoption of accept-reject and Metropolis-Hasting algorithms, as well as the efficacy of simulated generalized Bartlett methodology. The efficiency of selection methods has been enhanced by reducing the graph search space, and the use of penalized likelihood and pseudolikelihood methods has been explored to handle heteroscedastic errors and improve the accuracy of conclusions. The development of high-dimensional tests for detecting mutual independence and banded dependence structures has also been a significant area of advancement. These tests are constructed based on pairwise distances and covariances, and they fully capture non-linear and non-monotone dependence relationships. The application of Pearson correlation and rank correlation tests has been convenient, and their limiting properties have been demonstrated in normal distributions. Despite their excellent finite-size properties, these tests are limited in their ability to identify non-linear dependence in high-dimensional settings. The development of distance-weighted discrimination (DWD) as a modern margin classifier has been an interesting geometric motivation. Despite the recent reference to DWD as a competitor to support vector machines (SVM), DWD has been far less explored. However, recent advances in DWD methodology have greatly advanced the current approach, with the development of a generalized DWD algorithm that is over 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art. This algorithm exploits cone programming and an efficient scheme for tuning the generalized DWD, leading to improved classification accuracy and reduced computation time compared to SVM. The development of a systematic approach to constructing confidence regions for functions has also been a significant area of advancement. This approach involves developing an understanding and visualization strategy for constructing separable Hilbert space hyperellipsoids and hyperrectangles. The implementation of these methods, especially in the context of hypothesis testing and visualization tools, has been particularly powerful. The overcoming of challenges related to evaluating confidence regions, such as the phenomena of "ghosting," has been an important aspect of this research. The application of fractional anisotropy and tract profile analysis in unified theory has also been a significant advancement. This approach involves controlling experiments to balance baseline and treatment randomization, and it minimizes variance while ensuring a nearly perfect balance between structure dependence and outcome baseline. The use of modern optimization techniques for kernel allocation has been crucial in ensuring this balance, and it has led to significant improvements in the precision and power of hypothesis tests. The development of marginal test methods for detecting significant predictors and conditional quantiles in scalar responses has also been an important area of advancement. These methods involve fitting marginal quantile regression models to predictor time series data and using resampling techniques to calibrate the test. The non-regular limiting behavior of these tests makes them computationally feasible and applicable to high-dimensional predictors. The flexibility of these tests, combined with their robustness to outliers and responses, has made them particularly useful in applications such as human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance and gene coexpression patterns. The development of quantile contingency and SQUAC methods for inferring quantile associations and handling arbitrary complex association patterns has also been significant. These methods involve conditioning on features and exploiting the independence structure of the data. The asymptotic properties of these tests have been demonstrated, and they have shown promising results in applications such as gastric cancer gene coexpression network analysis. The application of marginal quantile regression and screening tests for regression models has also been an important area of advancement. These tests have the added advantage of being robust to outliers and responses, and they have been successfully applied in areas such as human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance and gene coexpression patterns. The development of fully functional break detection methodologies has also been a significant area of advancement. These methodologies rely on dimension reduction techniques and thorough asymptotic theory, and they have been shown to perform best in analogous functional principal component analysis. The application of these methods in annual temperature curve analysis has demonstrated their practical relevance. The application of contemporary scale analysis methods has also been an important area of advancement. These methods involve building interpretable linkages between potential responses and non-linear responses, and they have been extensively applied in binary modeling. The development of effective control strategies for false discovery rates in high-dimensional logistic regression has been a significant area of advancement. These strategies have been shown to be effective in controlling fraction false discoveries and addressing practical issues such as knockoff variables.

These algorithms have been shown to be effective in improving the efficiency of supervised learning and addressing issues such as overfitting. The application of these methods in evaluating phenotyping algorithms for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis has demonstrated their practical relevance. The development of instrumental variable methods for identifying average treatment effects and addressing unmeasured confounding has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in enabling identification of average treatment effects and clearly separating the researcher's required commitment to establishing identification from the construct of multiple consistent and multiply robust identification strategies. The development of flexible multivariate dependence structure modeling methods using copulas has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in modeling asymmetric dependence relationships and capturing joint tail behavior. The application of these methods in risk portfolio optimization and financial risk management has demonstrated their practical relevance. The development of driven multivariate time series analysis methods has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in characterizing long-run movements and rapid fluctuations in count data. The application of these methods in financial market analysis has demonstrated their practical relevance. The development of community structure analysis methods for empirical networks has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in capturing dynamic node popularity and providing improved empirical insights. The application of these methods in analyzing political blog networks, British Member of Parliament networks, and bibliographical networks has demonstrated their practical relevance. The development of matrix valued regression and sampling methods has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in handling matrix valued predictors and responses. The application of these methods in high-dimensional settings has demonstrated their practical relevance. The development of multiple hypothesis testing methods has also been a significant area of advancement. These methods have been shown to be effective in controlling false discovery rates and addressing issues such as adaptive thresholding.

Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention in recent years, particularly due to their ability to decompose complex Bayesian models into more tractable parts. This decomposition has led to significant gains in computational efficiency and scalability. In contrast, non-decomposable Bayesian models have been penalized in terms of their likelihood, but recent advancements have made these models more tractable as well. The scalability of Bayesian models at the level of success achieved, especially in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap between scalable and flexible Bayesian models, has been a major highlight.

The scalability of the Gibbs sampler, with significantly higher dimensionality, has been accepted, and its efficacy in terms of the accept-reject and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms has been demonstrated. The methodology of generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graphs has been shown to be efficient in model selection, reducing the graph search space and penalizing the likelihood. This has been particularly useful in handling heteroscedastic errors and avoiding inaccurate conclusions in nonparametric regression, where local polynomial smoothing tests are involved in detecting and verifying heteroscedasticity. The use of empirical residuals in constructing tests for detecting error variance and ensuring asymptotically free rates of convergence has been extended to missing responses and extended missing data problems.

Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention in recent years, particularly due to their decomposable nature which makes them significantly more tractable than non-decomposable models. This has led to a significant gain in scalability and tractability at the Bayesian level. Despite these successes, there remains a gap in addressing the scalability and flexibility of Bayesian models, particularly in the selection of Gaussian and undirected graphical models. Generalized Wishart distributions have been proposed as a solution, allowing for multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs, including those with Wishart special and generalized Bartlett graphs. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms have been developed for posterior draws of these generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graphs, which contain decomposable graphs as a special case. This allows for substantial computational gains, particularly in higher dimensions, where traditional methods may be less effective. The Gibbs sampler, in particular, has been shown to be significantly more scalable than other methods, with higher dimensionality being an area where it excels.

Heteroscedasticity is a challenge that must be properly addressed to avoid inaccurate conclusions in nonparametric regression. The method involves detecting and verifying heteroscedasticity by exploiting the independence or dependence structure of errors. This can be achieved through the construction of local polynomial smoothing tests and the use of empirical residuals. The method is particularly effective in high-dimensional settings, where it can identify non-linear dependencies and exhibit asymptotic normality.

Distance weighted discrimination (DWD) is a modern margin classifier with an interesting geometric motivation, offering a competitive alternative to support vector machines (SVM). Despite the recent advancements in DWD, it is still far less explored than SVM, mainly due to computational and theoretical reasons. However, recent developments in DWD have greatly advanced the current methodology, with state-of-the-art algorithms being up to a hundred times faster. These algorithms exploit efficient schemes, such as order cone programming, to tune generalized DWD and formulate it into natural kernels. DWD's consistency in Bayes risk and its ability to handle kernel DWD, universal kernels, and Gaussian kernels have led to it outperforming SVM in classification accuracy while requiring less computation time.

The construction of confidence regions for functions is a core concept that has received relatively little attention, despite being a fundamental question. A systematic approach to constructing these regions involves developing an understanding and visualization strategy, with the use of separable Hilbert spaces, hyperellipsoids, and hyper rectangles. This approach is especially powerful for hypothesis testing and visualization, overcoming challenges such as evaluating confidence regions and ensuring proper coverage.

The analysis of secondary outcomes in traditional secondary analysis can be complemented by employing completely parametric conditional regression links. This approach allows for a more insightful association analysis, particularly in biomedical outcomes that are highly asymmetric. Median regression, for example, can describe the central behavior of the response while regression research can focus on the high and low quantiles, likely indicating risk. This semiparametric perspective allows for completely unspecified consistent semiparametric identification and efficient member selection, with superior asymptotic properties compared to other methods.

Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention in recent years, particularly due to their ability to decompose complex Bayesian networks into more tractable components. This decomposition significantly enhances the scalability and tractability of Bayesian models, making them a popular choice for addressing complex problems in various fields. In contrast, non-decomposable Bayesian models have been penalized, with the penalized likelihood method gaining significant traction in the past year. Despite the success of scalable Bayesian models, there is still a gap in their ability to quantify uncertainty and flexibility, which has been addressed by the introduction of Gaussian undirected graphical models and generalized Wishart distributions. These models allow for the representation of multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs, including Wishart and special generalized Bartlett graphs. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms have been developed for posterior inference in these models, which contain both decomposable and non-decomposable graphs. The special structure of decomposable graphs allows for substantial computational gains, while the penalized likelihood approach has been extended to handle high-dimensional data. This has led to the development of a method for detecting heteroscedasticity in nonparametric regression models, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions if not properly handled. The methodology involves the construction of local polynomial smoothing tests and the exploitation of the dependence structure of the errors. This approach has been extended to high-dimensional data, where it can efficiently select important predictors and reduce the search space for graph structures. The penalized likelihood and pseudolikelihood methods have been shown to be effective in handling heteroscedastic errors and selecting valid instruments in instrumental variable models. These methods have been extended to the selection of valid instruments in high-dimensional settings, where the majority rule approach can be violated due to the nearly identical oracle optimality of the proposed methods. In the context of causal inference, the majority rule can be used to select valid instruments consistently, producing valid confidence intervals for the causal effect. The use of a high-dimensional oracle width rule can outperform traditional methods in recent invalid reanalyses of causal effects, such as those related to education and earnings. The application of modern machine learning techniques, such as semi-supervised learning, has been shown to be effective in the context of electronic medical records and phenotyping algorithms, with the use of knockoff variables leading to improved performance in controlling the false discovery rate. The use of functional data analysis techniques has been shown to be useful in the construction of confidence regions and the visualization of functional data, with the use of distance-based methods leading to efficient and consistent classification algorithms. The use of multivariate time series analysis techniques has been shown to be effective in the context of financial risk management and portfolio optimization, with the use of max copulas leading to improved performance in capturing joint movement in high-dimensional multivariate stock returns. The use of modern optimization techniques has been shown to be useful in the context of kernel allocation and the construction of confidence regions, with the use of modern optimization techniques leading to nearly perfect balance and improved performance in hypothesis testing. The use of marginal test methods has been shown to be useful in the context of regression analysis, with the use of marginal screening tests leading to improved performance in the detection of significant predictors. The use of matrix valued regression techniques has been shown to be useful in the context of high-dimensional data analysis, with the use of matrix normal distributions leading to improved performance in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The use of instrumental variable methods has been shown to be useful in the context of causal inference, with the use of penalized regression adjustment leading to improved performance in the estimation of average treatment effects.

In recent years, Bayesian graphical models have received significant attention, with decomposable Bayesian models becoming significantly more tractable. In contrast, non-decomposable models have been penalized, with the likelihood contrast making a tremendous gain. Despite the scalability of Bayesian models at a high level, there is a need to address the gap in scalable and flexible Bayesian selection. Gaussian undirected graphical models, generalized Wishart distributions, and multiple shape arbitrary graphs have been employed, with the Wishart distribution being a special case of the generalized Bartlett graph. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms have been developed to draw posteriors from generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graphs, which contain decomposable graphs as a special case. These graphs are substantially larger and proceed with a theoretical property of the Gibbs sampler.

In heteroscedastic error modeling, the challenge is to handle inaccurate conclusions properly. Tests for heteroscedasticity involve the detection and verification of error variance, with asymptotically free error rates made consistent. Parametric root rate convergence is extended to missing responses. Major challenges arise in instrumental variable analysis, where the presence of an unmeasured confounder can invalidate a putative fact. The stage of hard thresholding is used to select strong instruments, with candidate generation and validation proceeding through a majority or plurality rule. Low-dimensional invalid instruments are proposed, with the correct selection of valid instruments being crucial for consistently producing valid causal effects.

The modern machine learning application of outcome prediction, where data collection is expensive and time-consuming, has led to the development of semi-supervised learning methods. These methods aim to utilize a large amount of unlabelled data along with a smaller amount of labelled data to improve efficiency. Numerous semi-supervised learning methods for classification and prediction have been proposed, with recent years seeing an evaluation of prediction working in regression contexts. Developing phenotyping algorithms from electronic medical records is an efficient step in evaluating binary classifier predictions, with the semi-supervised step being labelled nonparametrically and calibrated conditional risk. The semi-supervised prediction accuracy is constructed from conditional risk, with the method being mildly regular and consistent asymptotically.

The analysis of secondary outcomes in conditional regression links secondary outcomes with quantile regression. This approach provides insight into associations and is highly asymmetric, with the median regression describing central behavior. Semiparametric perspectives allow for completely unspecified consistent semiparametric identification, with efficient members identified. The asymptotic properties of these methods are superior, far outperforming traditional methods.

In the construction of confidence regions for functional data, the methodology relies on dimension reduction techniques and thorough asymptotic theory. The fully functional break detection is performed, assuming a break size that shrinks to zero. The fully functional methodology performs best when compared to orthogonal leading principal components, with the theoretical confirmation coming from Monte Carlo finite applications.

This decomposition has led to remarkable gains in scalability and tractability, allowing for more successful Bayesian level analyses. While scalable Bayesian methods have their strengths, particularly in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap between scalability and flexibility in Bayesian selection, there remains a need for more efficient methods.

Theoretical properties of the Gibbs sampler, which is scalable and significantly more efficient in higher dimensions, are explored, along with its efficacy in simulated data. The methodology is also extended to handle heteroscedastic errors, which can lead to inaccurate conclusions if not properly addressed. This involves testing for heteroscedasticity and exploiting the dependence structure to detect and verify errors in variance. The methodology is shown to be asymptotically free of bias and consistent in its parametric root rate convergence.

2. Heteroscedasticity, or inaccurate conclusions due to inconsistent error variance, is properly handled through tests that exploit the dependence structure of errors. Nonparametric regression and multiple suitable residual constructions, such as the empirical residual, have been employed to construct local polynomial smoothing tests. These tests involve the detection and verification of heteroscedasticity, exploiting just independence and dependence structures. Error variance asymptotically free tests have been made consistent, with parametric root rate convergence extended to missing responses. Major challenges in instrumental variable analysis include validating the direct effect of an outcome and the presence of an unmeasured confounder. The instrumental average treatment effect is partially identifiable and can be addressed with identification strategies that clearly separate the researcher's required commitments.

Strategies for constructing confidence regions in separable Hilbert spaces, such as hyperellipsoids and hyper rectangles, have been implemented. Particularly powerful hypothesis tests rely on negative nearly zero coverage regions and working empirical covariances to overcome challenges in evaluating confidence regions. Ghosting, or empirical regions that do not coincide with the desired regions, is a phenomenon observed, and methods to shrink the regions to achieve proper coverage have been proposed. Fractional anisotropy and tract profile analyses have been applied to understand the application of confidence regions in medical imaging.

4. The controlled experiment, with its balance of baseline and priori treatment randomization, is crucial for minimax variance kernel allocation. The notion of priori balance must go hand-in-hand with the notion of structure dependence on the outcome and baseline. Complete randomization and special balance always ensure minimax, but they are restricting in terms of structure dependence. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches have been used to rise above imbalances, with metrics previously developed ad hoc. Modern optimization methods, such as kernel allocation, ensure nearly perfect balance while biasing or misspecifying can offer sizable advantages in precision and power. These methods have been demonstrated over a range of synthetic and strong theoretical guarantees, including variance consistency and rate convergence.

5. The marginal test for detecting significant predictors in conditional quantile regression has been devised, with the idea of fitting marginal quantile regression to the predictor and then testing the predictive power of the predictor. Resampling methods have been used to calibrate the test for non-regular limiting behavior and selection predictive asymptotic validity. Marginal quantile regression, while misspecified in dimension, still has asymptotic tests that are computationally feasible and applicable. The flexibility of marginal screening tests in regression has added an advantage in robustness to outliers and response applications, such as in human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance and gene coexpression patterns.

Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention in recent years, particularly due to their decomposable nature which renders them significantly more tractable than non-decomposable models. This has led to a substantial gain in scalability and tractability at the Bayesian level, with successes being especially evident in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap between scalable and flexible Bayesian methods. Despite these strengths, particularly in terms of scalability, the selection of Gaussian undirected graphical models and generalized Wishart models with multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs, including those with Wishart special and generalized Bartlett graphs, remains a challenge. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for posterior draws and the incorporation of penalized likelihoods have been crucial in overcoming these difficulties. Theoretical properties of the Gibbs sampler, including its scalability and significantly higher dimensionality, have been explored, with the acceptance-rejection and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms demonstrating efficacy in simulated generalized Bartlett methodologies. The efficient selection of reducing graph search space and penalized likelihoods, as well as pseudolikelihoods, has been instrumental in handling heteroscedastic errors and avoiding inaccurate conclusions. The proper handling of test heteroscedasticity through nonparametric regression and the construction of local polynomial smoothing tests, involving the detection and verification of heteroscedasticity, have been explored, exploiting the independence and dependence structure of errors. The asymptotically free consistent parametric root rate convergence and extended missing response methods have also been examined.

The Bayesian graphical model has received considerable attention in recent years, particularly due to its ability to decompose into more tractable sub-models. This approach has led to significant gains in scalability and tractability, as compared to non-decomposable Bayesian models. The penalized likelihood approach, which has been a cornerstone in Bayesian modeling, has also seen a remarkable upsurge in popularity, especially in the context of high-dimensional data. The Bayesian level of success, however, has been particularly pronounced in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap between scalable and flexible Bayesian models. The selection of Gaussian undirected graphical models, generalized Wishart distributions, and arbitrary graph structures containing Wishart special and generalized Bartlett graphs has led to more efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for posterior inference. These developments have significantly enhanced the scalability and computational efficiency of Bayesian models.

In recent years, Bayesian graphical models have garnered significant attention. The decomposable Bayesian models are notably more tractable, offering a substantial contrast to the non-decomposable models. While penalized likelihood methods have made great strides in scalability and tractability, the success of Bayesian models at this level is particularly notable. Bayesian models offer strengths in quantifying uncertainty and addressing gaps in scalable and flexible methods. The selection of Gaussian and undirected graphical models, as well as the generalized Wishart and multiple shape arbitrary graphs, has been efficient with Gibbs sampling algorithms. These algorithms have been instrumental in posterior draws, and the generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graphs have been particularly effective in containing decomposable and special, substantially larger decomposable graphs. The theoretical properties of the Gibbs sampler have been a driving force, offering scalability and significantly higher dimensionality acceptance and rejection methods. The efficacy of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm has been simulated, and the generalized Bartlett methodology has been efficient in selection, reducing the graph search space and penalized likelihood pseudolikelihood. The handling of heteroscedastic error through inaccurate conclusions has been properly addressed, and tests for heteroscedasticity have involved the detection and verification of error variance, exploiting just independence and dependence structures. The detection of error variance has been asymptotically free and consistent with parametric root rate convergence. This has been extended to missing responses and major challenges, such as the instrumental variable problem, where the presence of a valid direct effect on the outcome is uncertain. The thresholding step has been crucial for selecting strong instruments, generating candidates, and validating them through a majority or plurality rule. In low dimensions, the oracle optimality proposal has outperformed traditional methods, while in high dimensions, it has been nearly identical. The violation of the majority rule has led to high dimensions, where oracle optimality proposals have nearly identical results. The application of these methods has been demonstrated in education and earnings tests, as well as in tests for mutual independence and banded dependence structures in high-dimensional settings. The construction of basi pairwise distance covariance tests has accounted for non-linear and non-monotone dependencies, fully capturing them. The Pearson correlation and rank correlation tests have been conveniently implemented, with limiting tests exhibiting excellent finite-size properties. Despite the challenges in high dimensions, the identification of non-linear dependencies has been successful. The empirical success of these tests has been confirmed by theory, and the asymptotic normality test has been quite mild with little restriction on the growth rate. The distance covariance test, while infeasible in high dimensions, has been optimized for rate optimality, with Gaussian equal correlations.

Recent years have seen a surge in interest in Bayesian graphical models, particularly those that are decomposable, which offer significant tractability advantages over their non-decomposable counterparts. In contrast, the penalized likelihood approach has made tremendous strides in scalability and tractability at the Bayesian level. Despite these successes, there remains a gap in scalable, flexible Bayesian methods for variable selection. Gaussian and undirected graphical models, along with generalized Wishart and multiple shape arbitrary graphs, have been shown to be efficient in Gibbs sampling algorithms. The posterior distribution can be drawn using generalized Wishart and generalized Bartlett graphs, which contain decomposable graphs as a special case. This theoretical property of the Gibbs sampler allows for scalability and significantly higher-dimensional acceptance-reject Metropolis-Hasting algorithms. However, the efficacy of the simulated generalized Bartlett methodology has yet to be fully explored in the context of penalized likelihood and pseudolikelihood.

Bayesian graphical models have received considerable attention in recent years, with the decomposable Bayesian model demonstrating significant tractability. In contrast, the non-decomposable model has been penalized for its likelihood, leading to a tremendous gain in scalability and tractability at the Bayesian level. Despite the successes of scalable Bayesian models, especially in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap in flexible Bayesian selection, the Gaussian undirected graphical model and the generalized Wishart have been generalized to include multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs. Efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms have been developed for posterior draws of the generalized Wishart and the generalized Bartlett graph, which contain decomposable and special graphs, allowing for substantially larger decomposable graphs to be handled. Theoretical properties of the Gibbs sampler have been explored, showing that it is scalable and significantly more efficient in higher dimensions. Accept-reject and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms have been proposed to enhance the efficacy of sampling, while penalized likelihood and pseudo-likelihood have been used to handle heteroscedastic error and inaccurate conclusions.

Heteroscedasticity is a major challenge in nonparametric regression, where the test for heteroscedasticity involves exploiting the dependence structure to detect error variance. Asymptotically, the test becomes free of parametric root rate convergence, and the extended missing response method has been developed to address missing data issues. Instrumental variable analysis has been used to identify valid direct effects and outcomes, but the presence of unmeasured confounding has led to the need for instrumental average treatment effect analysis, which partially addresses the issue of identification.

The major challenge in instrumental variable analysis is determining whether a putative fact is valid. Hard thresholding and voting methods have been proposed to select strong instruments, and a candidate selection process involving a majority or plurality rule has been developed to determine true validity. In low dimensions, invalid instruments can be proposed and corrected, while in high dimensions, the oracle optimality proposal outperforms traditional methods in reanalyzing causal effects.

In the context of modern machine learning, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a discipline with core concepts and perspectives. It aims to utilize the amount of unlabeled data along with the amount of labeled data to improve efficiency. While numerous semi-supervised learning methods have been developed for classification and prediction, there has been limited evaluation of these methods in a regression context. Developing phenotyping algorithms using electronic medical records is an efficient step in evaluating binary classifier predictions in semi-supervised learning, which can be applied to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

In recent years, Bayesian graphical models have garnered significant attention for their ability to decompose complex structures into more manageable parts, making them significantly more tractable. The contrast between decomposable and non-decomposable Bayesian models, especially when penalized likelihood is considered, has led to significant gains in scalability and tractability at the Bayesian level. While scalable Bayesian models have their strengths, especially in quantifying uncertainty and addressing the gap between scalability and flexibility in Bayesian selection, the past year has seen a substantial rise in the success of scalable Bayesian models. These models, particularly Gaussian undirected graphical models and generalized Wishart models, have shown efficiency in handling multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs, including special generalized Bartlett graphs. The introduction of efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms for posterior draws has been instrumental in this progress.

The theoretical property of the Gibbs sampler, its scalability, and its significantly higher dimensional acceptance-reject Metropolis-Hasting algorithm have enhanced its efficacy. Simulated generalized Bartlett methodologies have also been efficient in selection, reducing the graph search space and penalized likelihood. The pseudolikelihood approach, while not as accurate as the true likelihood, has proven useful in handling heteroscedastic error and testing for heteroscedasticity in nonparametric regression.

Multiple suitable residual empirical residuals have been constructed for local polynomial smoothing tests that involve the detection and verification of heteroscedasticity. Exploiting the dependence structure, these tests have been shown to be asymptotically free and consistent. The parametric root rate convergence and the extended missing response methods have also been extended to handle missing data.

A major challenge in causal inference is validating the presence of an instrumental variable, especially when the effect is unsure or the presence invalid. Hard thresholding and voting methods have been employed to select strong instruments and generate candidates, with the majority or plurality rule determining the true valid instrument. In low dimensions, these methods work well, but in higher dimensions, they become nearly identical, and the oracle optimality proposal outperforms traditional methods.

In education and earnings, the test for mutual independence and the construction of a banded dependence structure for high-dimensional tests have proven effective. These tests are constructed based on pairwise distances and covariances, fully capturing non-linear and non-monotone dependencies. The Pearson correlation and rank correlation tests are conveniently implemented and exhibit excellent finite-size properties. However, they may not identify non-linear dependencies, and the empirical success of these tests in theory has not been matched in practice.

In modern machine learning, the application of outcome prediction, especially in cases where collecting the outcome is expensive and time-consuming, has led to a surge in the use of semi-supervised learning. This approach aims to utilize the amount of unlabelled data along with the amount of labelled data to improve efficiency. While numerous semi-supervised learning methods exist for classification prediction, recent years have seen a shift towards evaluating predictions in a regression context. Developing phenotyping algorithms from electronic medical records has become an efficient step in evaluating binary classifiers, with the semi-supervised step providing labelled data for calibration and conditional risk estimation. This approach has shown mild regularity and consistency, asymptotically approaching normality. The asymptotic variance of semi-supervised learning is always smaller than that of its supervised counterpart, offering a correct specification and potential reduction in overfitting.

The Bayesian graphical model has garnered significant interest in recent years. The decomposable Bayesian model, with its tractable nature, has seen a remarkable surge in popularity, especially in comparison to the non-decomposable models. This shift is due in part to the scalability and tractability of Bayesian models at large. While the scalable Bayesian models have their strengths, especially in quantifying uncertainty, there is a gap that needs to be addressed in terms of flexibility. The selection of Gaussian undirected graphical models and generalized Wishart distributions for multiple shapes and arbitrary graphs, including Wishart special and generalized Bartlett graphs, has led to more efficient Gibbs sampling algorithms and posterior draws. These developments have significantly improved the computational efficiency of Bayesian models. Theoretical properties of the Gibbs sampler, such as its scalability and significantly higher dimensionality acceptance-rejection methods, have also been enhanced. These advancements have made Bayesian models more accessible and adaptable to a broader range of applications.

Heteroscedastic errors, often a source of inaccurate conclusions, are now being properly handled through sophisticated tests that verify heteroscedasticity. This involves constructing local polynomial smoothing tests and employing empirical residuals to detect and verify heteroscedasticity. The methodology has been extended to nonparametric regression and multiple suitable residual constructions. The tests, which involve the detection and verification of heteroscedasticity, are exploiting the independence and dependence structures to ensure accurate results. The asymptotically free error variance tests have been made consistent with the parametric root rate convergence. This has extended the methodology to missing responses and instrumental variables.

A major challenge in causal inference is dealing with the presence of unmeasured confounding, which can invalidate the validity of the putative causal effect. The instrumental variable approach offers a way to address this issue by enabling identification of the average treatment effect under certain conditions. However, researchers must commit to establishing identification through the construction of multiple consistent and multiply robust identification strategies. The binary outcome setting ensures that the average treatment effect lies within a bounded range, guaranteeing its identification. This has been a significant area of focus in evaluating causal effects, such as in the education and earnings context.

The non-linear construction of flexible multivariate dependence structures using copulas has opened up new avenues for modeling. The straightforward pairwise max rule has led to the construction of new max copulas, which are closed and have strong interpretability. These max copulas are capable of modeling asymmetric dependence and joint tail behavior, offering good modeling for non-extreme behaviors. The single-factor and block-factor max copulas offer parsimonious modeling of structured dependence, especially in high-dimensional applications. The combination of max copulas with semiparametric time models has led to flexible and accurate multivariate time series modeling. The consistency and asymptotic normality properties of these models have been established, making them a promising choice for risk portfolio optimization and financial risk management.

The empirical network analysis has focused on capturing dynamic node popularity and community structures in empirical networks. The stochastic block model and degree-corrected extensions have been used to model node popularity and community structures, offering a more realistic and flexible approach. These methods have been applied to political blog networks, British Member Parliament networks, and digital bibliographic networks, providing improved empirical insights. The methodology has been extended to matrix-valued responses, where matrix variate regression and envelope methods have been employed to tackle multiple graphs and reduce redundant variation. This has led to significant gains in efficiency, especially in high-dimensional settings.

The multiple hypothesis testing framework has seen advancements with the introduction of iterative adaptive thresholding methods. These methods adaptively control the false discovery rate (FDR) and offer promising power in hypothesis testing. The iterative adaptive thresholding approach allows analysts to choose the threshold, switch iterations, and accumulate favorable adaptations. This compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods in five applications. The ensemble decision tree tools, such as gradient boosted decision trees and random forests, have shown potential in obtaining flexible regression and classification models. These tree ensemble methods have overcome shortcomings like lack of smoothness and the curse of dimensionality. The Bayesian additive regression trees have shown strong theoretical support and promising results in benchmarks, with posterior concentration on minimax rates and logarithmic factors. These developments have made Bayesian models more adaptable and scalable in high-dimensional regimes.
