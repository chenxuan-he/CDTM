By adopting a spatially indexed mixed effects model, we allow for the consideration of high correlations and the understanding of the effects of risk factors on health outcomes. Our model incorporates a continuous latent multivariate Gaussian, which jointly models explanatory risk factors and spatial dependence. This approach provides flexibility in adjusting for confounders and accounting for residual spatial structures, potentially revealing unmeasured or undiscovered factors.

By utilizing a distributional skew normal family, we develop an exact likelihood framework that accommodates the complexities of real-world data, such as dropout and event history. Our approach discretizes the timescale of time-to-event outcomes, enabling efficient computation while maintaining accuracy. This method has been applied to a cystic fibrosis cohort, demonstrating its utility in disease research.
