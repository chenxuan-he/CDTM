5. Spatial modelling is enhanced through the use of a continuously indexed Gaussian field (GF), which serves as an ingredient in geostatistical specifications. The GF offers an intuitive interpretation of field properties, while its computational aspect presents a significant challenge due to the high-dimensionality and cubic computational cost. However, the application of the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) discretely indexed offers a sparse precision matrix, enabling efficient numerical algorithms and reducing the required time for computation. This allows for the formulation of thebasi representation, potentially providing a generalizable framework for covariance-generated stochastic partial differential equations and the analysis of global temperature trends on non-stationary manifolds.
