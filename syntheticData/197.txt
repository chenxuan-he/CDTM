The Bayesian reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo method allows for Bayesian semiparametric specification, specifying a flexible spatial hierarchical model with a Markov random field for the Poisson rate. Synthetic allocation techniques help avoid oversmoothing rates, demonstrating the method's efficacy in epidemiologic applications for rare cancer cases in France.
