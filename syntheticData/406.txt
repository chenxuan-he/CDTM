By employing a composite likelihood approach, researchers can maximize a closed exponential family likelihood function, which serves as a practical approximation to the full maximum likelihood estimation. This method finds applications in directional bivariate analysis, such as von Mises distributions, enabling efficient representation of complex systems.
