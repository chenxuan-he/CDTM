This results in more accurate confidence regions at the nominal level, enhancing the precision of the analysis. The findings of this study extend to nonparametric methods for assessing semiparametric regression models and provide insights into the evaluation of the association in conditional random forests with arbitrary measures.

1. The present study examines the properties of the empirical likelihood method in the context of partially linear single-index models. Unlike the simpler bias correction limits for empirical likelihood, the ratio of the empirical likelihood is shown to be asymptotically tractable under certain conditions. The challenge lies in achieving the chi-squared limit for the bias correction while maintaining the desired feature of least squares estimation. Nonparametric undersmoothing techniques are employed to ensure root consistency is avoided, resulting in a bias-corrected empirical likelihood ratio that shares the desired properties. This approach introduces a self-scaling invariant plug-in estimator with limiting variance, which necessitates an index norm constraint to increase accuracy. The confidence regions resulting from the bias-corrected empirical likelihood are smaller than those at the nominal level, offering a more precise estimation. This research sheds light on the application of the bias-corrected empirical likelihood in nonparametric checking and semiparametric regression analysis, providing insights into the assessment of conditional associations in arbitrary settings.
