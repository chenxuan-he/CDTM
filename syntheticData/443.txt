1. Structural equation models (SEM) are a subclass of causal Bayesian networks that allow for the presence of latent confounders and cycles, thus generalizing the causal modeling capabilities of acyclic SEM. These models always hold the convenient property of acyclic SEM, ensuring that a solution always exists and induces a unique observational and interventional counterfactual. Marginalization always exists and preserves the Markov property, ensuring that the graphs are always consistent with causal semantics. The properties of solvability and generalizability are always satisfied, even in the presence of cycles.

2. The SCM (structural causal model) is a fundamental concept in the theory of causal modeling. It allows for multiple tests to be controlled for tail probability, false discovery proportion, and familywise error rate, all simultaneously. It encompasses controlling the familywise error rate, the generalized familywise error rate, and the false discovery exceedance rate. By controlling these errors, the SCM ensures accurate and reliable results in causal modeling.

3. Nonparametric structural equation modeling (NPSM) is a powerful tool for causal modeling that does not require specific assumptions about the functional form of the relationships between variables. It allows for the presence of latent confounders and cycles, making it more flexible and applicable to a wider range of situations than acyclic SEM. NPSM preserves the convenient properties of acyclic SEM, ensuring that a solution always exists and is unique.

4. Causal discovery using SCM involves finding the causal structure and order of variables in a system. It can consistently recover the causal order even in the presence of nonextremal causal relationships. SCM uses a computationally efficient algorithm to consistently recover the causal structure, making it a powerful tool for causal discovery in synthetic and real-world data.

5. Causal tail coefficients are a measure of the asymmetry in the dependence of variables at the extremes of their distributions. They capture the causal structure between variables, following the linear structural causal model even in the presence of latent causes. Causal tail coefficients are computationally efficient and can consistently recover the causal order in nonextremal causal discovery, providing a valuable tool for understanding the causal relationships in a system.

1. Structural causal models, or SCMs, are a nonparametric form of structural equation modeling used for causal analysis. These models can handle the presence of latent confounders and cycles, making them a versatile tool for causal inference. The acyclic nature of SCMs ensures that solutions are always unique and induce observational and interventional counterfactuals. Marginalization in SCMs always exists, and latent projections satisfy the Markov property, maintaining consistency with causal semantics.

2. The subclass of SCMs known as generalized causal Bayesian networks, or GCBNs, is particularly useful for causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders and cycles. These models allow for the convenient property of acyclic structures while also accommodating cyclic dependencies. The aim of GCBNs is to establish a foundational theory for causal modeling, offering multiple testing procedures that control tail probabilities and false discovery rates.

3. Advances in nonparametric causal modeling have led to the development of methods that can handle high-dimensional data, such as gene tests in genomic clusters and neuroimaging studies.

The practical usefulness of these methods is evident in their application to real-world data, where they have demonstrated improved closed test procedures and admissibility in local testing.

4. Nonparametric regression techniques, such as epsilon-centered error tests and maximum absolute deviation regression, have been refined for use in high-dimensional settings. These methods are characterized by their consistency and asymptotic behavior, and they have been successfully applied to fields such as computational biology and remote sensing. The key to their success lies in the suitable restrictions placed on the regression structures, ensuring that the methods can handle the curse of dimensionality effectively.

5. In the field of signal recovery, the combination of total variation regularization and mathematical imaging tools has proven to be highly effective. This approach has excellent theoretical support and has been confirmed through practical applications. The constrained total variation framework, combined with overcomplete frames and white noise regression, offers a powerful tool for denoising high-dimensional signals and achieving minimax optimality in risk.

1. Causal modeling through structural causal models (SCM) offers a nonparametric approach to analyze the relationships between variables, ensuring the presence of latent confounders and cycles. The acyclic SCM maintains a convenient property of always having a unique solution, which is also induced by unique observational and interventional counterfactuals. The marginalization process in SCM always exists, leading to latent projections that satisfy the Markov property. This ensures that the graphs are consistent with causal semantics. SCM's solvability and generalizability are further enhanced by the cyclic SCM, a special case that preserves the convenient properties of the acyclic SCM.

2. In multiple hypothesis testing, controlling for false discovery proportion and random simultaneous testing, encompassing controlling the familywise error rate, generalized familywise error rate, and false discovery exceedance, the joint error rate simultaneously controls the false discovery proportion. Gene tests, genomic cluster analyses, and neuroimaging studies benefit from closed tests that uniformly improve performance. Moreover, the admissibility of local tests implies designing sufficient restrictions, focusing on closed tests for practical usefulness, and obtaining informative higher criticism through constructing uniform improvements.

3. The trimmed minimal process produces independent and identically distributed vectors, where the change in state becomes manifest through modifications in the marginal dependence structure. This impedes surveillance but raises the alarm in a timely manner when using control charts. The difficulty in obtaining expressions for the overall average run length (ARL) and false alarm ARL (ARL0) is mitigated by the asymptotic independence of control run lengths, which are asymptotically exponentially distributed. This enables uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for ARL0, with assertions made about the CUSUM control chart by Shiryaev and Robert.

4. Nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error tests and hypothesis tests based on maximum absolute deviation regression are useful for functional integral thresholds. The cap infinity maximum deviation and limiting appropriately standardized cap infinity standardization are refined for consistency. Empirical likelihood in extended semiparametric models, weakly dependent partially linear single index regression, and conditional past vector parametric conditional variance added capture nonlinear effects. The empirical log-likelihood ratio behaves asymptotically despite its popularity and practical success.

5. The spherical functional autoregressive process exhibits consistency in the sup norm, validated by a quantitative central limit theorem and Wasserstein distance weak convergence under restrictive regularity. This is confirmed by numerical investigations, leading to a better understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the process.

1. Structural causal modeling (SCM) is a nonparametric approach to structural equation modeling that allows for the presence of latent confounders and cycles. It generalizes causal Bayesian networks and has the convenient property of always having a solution. The acyclic SCM always induces a unique observational and interventional counterfactual, and marginalization always exists. The latent projection always satisfies the Markov property, and the graphs are always consistent with causal semantics. The SCM properties hold for solvability and generalizability, and the cycle SCM is a special case of the acyclic SCM that preserves the convenient properties.

2. Causal modeling with SCM involves multiple tests for controlling tail probability, false discovery proportion, and randomization. It encompasses controlling familywise error rates, generalized familywise error rates, and false discovery exceedance. The joint error rate control for false discovery proportion in gene tests and genomic cluster analysis is equivalent to closed testing. It uniformly improves the closed test and is admissible for local tests. The design of sufficient restrictions on closed tests is based on the principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements.

3. The random vector process with adversarial contamination is a multivariate extension of the trimmed minimal process. It produces independent and identically distributed vectors, but its state can change and become manifest through modifications to the marginal dependence structure. This impairs surveillance and joint control chart construction. However, by separately raising alarms at the control chart coordinates, the difficulty in obtaining expressions for the overall average run length (ARL) and false alarm (FA) is reduced. Despite the dependence structure, the process control ARL and FA run lengths are asymptotically independent and exponentially distributed, enabling an uncomplicated asymptotic expression for ARL FA.

4. Detecting abrupt changes, possibly in nonstationary time series, is the aim of change detection methods. These methods identify regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior, which is reasonable for abrupt changes but not for gradual changes. The methodology for detecting gradual changes precisely involves nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error tests, hypothesis tests using maximum absolute deviation regression, functional integral tests, and subset tests. The limiting behavior of these tests is appropriately standardized, and the consistency of the refined tests has been empirically proven.

5. The recent advancements in nonparametric regression using deep learning neural networks have overcome the curse of dimensionality through suitable restrictions on network architecture, such as sparsity. The key feature of neural networks is the network architecture constraint, which is crucial for achieving good regression performance. The hidden layers tend to infinity, but their size grows suitably fast, bounded by a logarithmic factor. The proof of approximation concerning deep neural networks has been established, and the theory has been confirmed through practical applications in fields such as computational biology and remote sensing.

1. The structural causal model (SCM) is a nonparametric approach to causal inference that accounts for latent confounders and cycles in the data. It generalizes the causal Bayesian network and allows for the presence of latent confounders and cycles, which is a convenient property of the acyclic SCM. The solution to the SCM is always unique and induces a unique observational and interventional counterfactual. Marginalization always exists, and the latent projection always satisfies the Markov property. The graphs are always consistent with the causal semantics of the SCM. The solvability properties of the general SCM hold, with the cycle SCM being a special case. The acyclic SCM preserves the convenient properties and is the foundation of causal modeling theory.

2. Multiple testing can be controlled by tail probability, false discovery proportion, or family-wise error rate. Controlling the false discovery proportion in gene testing or genomic cluster analysis is equivalent to controlling the closed test error rate, which is uniformly improved by the closed test. The closed test is admissible if the local test is admissible, implying that designing sufficient closed tests is practically useful. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements is a key concept in multiple testing.

3. The change detection problem aims to detect abrupt changes in possibly nonstationary time series. Identifying regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior is a reasonable application of change detection. Gradual changes are irrelevant in this context, and the methodology used to detect gradual changes is not suitable for detecting abrupt changes. The epsilon-centered error test, maximum absolute deviation regression, and functional integral test are methods used to detect abrupt changes precisely.

4. Nonparametric regression and deep learning neural networks have been shown to be effective in high-dimensional settings, thanks to suitable restrictions on the network architecture. The key feature of neural networks is the network sparsity, which allows for the least square estimation of a fully connected neural network with ReLU activation neurons. The hidden layer size tends to infinity at a suitably fast rate, bounded by a logarithmic factor in the size of the neuron layer. This property makes neural networks suitable for high-dimensional regression problems.

5. Density deconvolution is a technique used to construct density estimates in the presence of measurement error. The methodology involves constructing density deconvolution using Fourier transform techniques, and it covers both vanishing and nonvanishing characteristic measurement errors. An upper bound on the risk is obtained under sufficient conditions on the characteristic effect, and the accuracy of the density deconvolution is discussed.

1. In the realm of causal modeling, Structural Causal Models (SCM) serve as a nonparametric structural equation framework for causal inference. These models, which are a subclass of SCM, generalize causal Bayesian networks and allow for the presence of latent confounders, even in the presence of cycles. The convenient property of acyclic SCM, which ensures that a unique solution always exists, is preserved in cyclic SCM, making it a useful tool for causal discovery. The presence of cycles, however, requires special attention to maintain the convenient properties of acyclic SCM, and the aim is to establish a foundation for the theory of causal modeling with SCM. 

2. The issue of multiple testing and controlling tail probabilities in false discovery is a crucial aspect of statistical analysis. Controlling the false discovery proportion (FDR) simultaneously for random tests encompasses controlling the familywise error rate (FWER) and the generalized FWER. It is important to note that the FDR can exceed the joint error rate, and simultaneous control of FDR in gene tests for genomic clusters and neuroimaging is essential. Closed tests provide a uniformly improved approach, and admissible local tests imply a sufficient restriction on the design, making closed tests practically useful. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements through random vectors and adversarial contamination is a significant advancement in this field.

3. The analysis of process control and the control chart is fundamental in statistical process control. Despite the dependence structure in the process, the average run length (ARL) of false alarms can be obtained through asymptotic independence and exponentially distributed control run lengths. This enables the use of asymptotic expressions for ARL of false alarms and simplifies the analysis. The CUSUM control chart, as developed by Shiryaev and Robert, is particularly effective in detecting abrupt changes in nonstationary time series, and its change detection capabilities are applicable in various fields, including microscopy and telescope imaging.

4. The concept of resolution in microscopy and its description using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF) has been a subject of debate. The argument for a random notion of discernability, based on the total intensity of an object in Poisson measurements, challenges the traditional view of resolution. The detection boundary for minimax detection using FWHM is linear for homogeneous Gaussian dependence, while it becomes nonlinear for inhomogeneous Gaussian dependence, highlighting the inadequacy of modeling physical scales with homogeneous Gaussian assumptions.

5. The field of nonparametric regression has seen significant developments, particularly with the integration of deep learning neural networks. These networks, with their hidden layers and relu activation neurons, have the ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality through suitable restriction structures. The architecture constraints, such as network sparsity, are key features that enable the approximation capabilities of deep neural networks. Moreover, the construction of density deconvolution using Fourier transform techniques is effective in handling measurement errors, including zero-line characteristics and the necessary conditions for accuracy in deconvolution.

1. The structural causal model (SCM) is a nonparametric structural equation model that is used for causal modeling. It has the purpose of representing acyclic causal relationships and can handle the presence of latent confounders. The acyclic SCM has the convenient property that it always has a unique solution that can induce observational and interventional counterfactuals through marginalization. The presence of cycles in the SCM is allowed, which is a useful property for handling cyclic causal relationships. The SCM always satisfies the Markov property for graphs, which ensures that the causal semantics of the SCM are consistent. The solvability and generalizability of the SCM are properties that hold for both acyclic and cyclic SCMs. The aim of the SCM is to provide a foundation for the theory of causal modeling.

2. In multiple testing, controlling the tail probability of false discovery is important to avoid making too many false discoveries. The proportion of false discoveries can be controlled by simultaneously testing all hypotheses, encompassing the familywise error rate, the generalized familywise error rate, and the false discovery exceedance rate. By controlling the false discovery proportion, gene tests, genomic clusters, and neuroimaging can be analyzed more effectively. Closed tests, which are uniformly improved, are admissible local tests that imply designing tests with sufficient restrictions. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements can be applied to random vectors with adversarial contamination.

3. Nonparametric regression is a powerful tool for analyzing data with complex structures. It can handle nonlinear relationships and does not require restrictive assumptions about the functional form of the data. Nonparametric regression can be used for functional data analysis, where the data are functions or curves, and for spatial data analysis, where the data have a spatial structure. Nonparametric regression can also be used for time series analysis, where the data are collected over time. The key advantage of nonparametric regression is its flexibility, which allows it to model a wide range of data types and structures.

4. Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, providing a powerful framework for modeling complex data and making predictions. The key feature of deep learning is its ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, which allows it to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. Deep learning has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. The development of deep learning has been driven by the availability of large amounts of data and the computational resources required to train deep neural networks.

5. Bayesian nonparametric survival modeling is a flexible and powerful approach for analyzing survival data. It allows for the modeling of hazard rates and does not require restrictive assumptions about the distribution of the survival times. Bayesian nonparametric survival modeling can handle right censoring and can be applied to both individual and grouped survival data. The key advantage of Bayesian nonparametric survival modeling is its ability to provide a full Bayesian characterization of the survival process, which allows for the calculation of posterior probabilities and credible intervals. Bayesian nonparametric survival modeling has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including medical research and actuarial science.

The properties of solvability and generalizability of SCM hold, with special consideration for cyclic structures. The aim is to establish a foundation for the theory of causal modeling with SCM.

2. Controlling for false discovery proportion in multiple tests is achieved through various methods, such as controlling the tail probability and the familywise error rate, and generalized familywise error rate.

The closed test is admissible, and local tests are admissible, implying that designing sufficient tests can restrict attention to closed tests, which is of practical usefulness. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements with random vectors is explored.

3. The process of producing independent and identically distributed vectors can be modified to become manifest in the marginal dependence structure, impeding surveillance. Jointly constructed control charts with separate coordinates raise alarms at different times, making it difficult to obtain an expression for the overall average run length of false alarms. Despite the dependence structure of the process, control charts with false alarm run lengths run in parallel and are asymptotically independent, enabling uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for the average run length of false alarms. Assertions about the CUSUM control chart and its relation to the Shiryaev-Robert control chart are discussed.

4. The aim of change detection is to detect abrupt changes, possibly in nonstationary time series, and to identify regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior. This methodology is reasonable for changes that occur gradually, as smooth gradual changes are considered nonrelevant. The methodology for detecting smooth changes precisely involves nonparametric regression and epsilon-centered error tests, hypothesis tests using maximum absolute deviation regression, and functional integral methods. The use of appropriately standardized thresholds and subset tests for hypothesis testing is discussed, along with the characterization of variance using empirical log-likelihood ratios and the asymptotic behavior of nonparametric ratios.

5. The use of total variation (TV) regularization in signal denoising, especially in higher-dimensional signals, remains an elusive topic today. The constrained TV overcomplete frame and the use of white noise regression for TV regularization's minimax optimality in risk are explored. The tool of mathematical imaging, signal recovery, and the combination of TV regularization and frame constraints, such as the Besov norm and interpolation inequalities, are discussed. Additionally, the explanation of phase transitions in minimax risk and the relationship between the BV norm and the exchangeable array, a natural tool for modeling dependence among units, are examined.

2. Advances in nonparametric regression techniques, particularly those inspired by deep learning and neural networks, have opened new possibilities in high-dimensional data analysis. These methods can bypass the curse of dimensionality through suitable architectural constraints and regularization. The use of hidden layers with ReLU activation functions and bounded sizes offers a promising approach to handling complex dependencies. Furthermore, density deconvolution techniques, utilizing Fourier transforms, provide robust methods for handling measurement errors, which are crucial in applications where data is contaminated or obscured.

3. The application of extreme value theory to causal analysis has led to the development of the causal tail coefficient, a measure that captures asymmetries in extremal dependence. This coefficient can reveal underlying causal structures, especially when combined with linear structural causal models. Computational efficiency is a key advantage, as algorithms can consistently recover causal orders and structures from nonextremal data. This advancement opens avenues for causal discovery in fields where extreme events play a significant role.

4. Improvements in regression and classification rates through the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Gaussian kernels have been demonstrated, particularly in low-dimensional spaces with intrinsic structures. The replacement of the ambient space dimension with the box-counting dimension in SVMs has shown to enhance learning rates, achieving minimax optimality. The selection of hyperparameters and the adaptive achievement of rates based on knowledge generation are critical factors in optimizing SVM performance.

5. The study of autoregressive processes with spherical functional kernels has yielded insights into their consistency and convergence properties.

The concept of closed testing and its practical utility in obtaining informative results through higher criticism is discussed, as well as the application of these techniques in fields like gene expression analysis and image processing.

3. Process control charts are instrumental in monitoring processes for changes, but the presence of dependence structures can impede their effectiveness. The study of asymptotic independence in control run lengths enables the use of simpler expressions for the overall average run length of false alarms. Notably, the CUSUM algorithm by Shiryaev is highlighted for its ability to detect abrupt changes, even in nonstationary processes. The exploration of methods to detect gradual changes and the challenges they present in the context of process control is also detailed.

The study of the behavior of hidden layers and the approximation properties of deep neural networks is detailed. Additionally, the use of empirical likelihood in semiparametric models and its asymptotic behavior is explored. The application of these methods in fields such as computational biology, remote sensing, and image processing is highlighted, showcasing the theoretical and practical success of these techniques.

1. Structural causal models (SCM) are a nonparametric form of structural equation modeling that is used for causal modeling. They have the purpose of representing causal relationships in an acyclic manner. SCMs are a subclass of recursive SEM that can generalize causal Bayesian networks and allow for the presence of latent confounders. The presence of cycles is not allowed in SCM, which conveniently ensures that the solution is always unique and observational. Interventional counterfactuals can be marginalized, and they always exist if the SCM is acyclic. Latent projections always satisfy the Markov property, and the graphs are always consistent with the causal semantics of SCM. The solvability properties of generalizable SCM hold, even in the presence of cycles, although special care must be taken for cyclic SCM. Acyclic SCM aims to provide a foundation for the theory of causal modeling.

2. In multiple hypothesis testing, controlling the tail probability of false discoveries is crucial. This can be achieved by controlling the family-wise error rate or the generalized family-wise error rate. False discovery exceedance and joint error rate control are also important aspects to consider. Closed testing procedures are commonly used to control the false discovery proportion, and they can be uniformly improved. Moreover, closed tests are admissible and imply that local tests are also admissible. Designing sufficient closed tests is a practical and useful principle for obtaining informative higher criticism. Random vector contamination and multivariate extensions with trimmed minimal processes can also be considered in this context.

3. Nonparametric regression is a powerful tool for analyzing data with hidden layers in deep learning neural networks. It can help to circumvent the curse of dimensionality and maintain suitable restrictions on the regression structure. Key features of neural networks, such as network architecture constraints and sparsity, can be captured through nonparametric regression. The network architecture constraint, namely the sparsity of the network, can be achieved through the use of a fully connected neural network with ReLU activation neurons in the hidden layers. The size of the hidden layer tends to infinity, but it does so suitably fast, with the size of the neuron in the hidden layer tending to infinity at a logarithmic factor of the size.

4. Density deconvolution with measurement error is a technique constructed using Fourier transform methods. It is characterized by measurement errors that tend to zero, although strong fulfillment of this characteristic is not always necessary. Constructing density deconvolution can cover both vanishing and nonvanishing characteristics of measurement error. An upper bound on the risk can be obtained with sufficient zero characteristic effect accuracy. Moreover, it is necessary to consider instances where the characteristic measurement error is nonvanishing. The accuracy of the density deconvolution can be improved by considering the upper bound on the risk.

5. Causal questions are omnipresent in scientific research, and much progress has been made in understanding causal relationships between random variables. Causal mechanisms can manifest themselves in extreme events, and the aim is to connect the field of causal extreme theory. Causal tail coefficients can capture the asymmetry in the extremal dependence of random variables and reveal the causal structure. Linear structural causal models hold in the presence of latent causes, and the tail index is consistent with the causal tail coefficient. A computationally highly efficient algorithm can consistently recover the causal order and discover nonextremal causal relationships. Synthetic code and open access packages are available for this purpose.

1. Causal inference is a field of statistics that aims to draw conclusions about causal relationships between variables based on observational data. Structural causal models (SCM) are a type of statistical model that allows researchers to represent the causal structure of a system, and to reason about the effects of interventions or counterfactuals. Nonparametric structural equation models (SEM) generalize the traditional SEM framework by allowing for more flexible specification of functional relationships between variables. Causal modeling with SCMs is purposeful and acyclic, meaning that causal relationships do not form cycles. Recursive SEMs are a subclass of SCM that generalize causal Bayesian networks and allow for the presence of latent confounders. The convenient property of acyclic SCMs is that they always have a solution, which always induces a unique observational and interventional counterfactual. Marginalization in SCMs always exists, and the latent projections always satisfy the Markov property. Graphs in SCMs are always consistent with causal semantics. The solvability and generalizability of SCMs depend on the presence or absence of cycles. Cyclic SCMs, which preserve the convenient property of acyclic SCMs, aim to lay the foundation for the theory of causal modeling.

2. Multiple hypothesis testing is a common challenge in statistical analysis, as it can lead to an increased probability of false discoveries. Controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER) and the false discovery proportion (FDP) are key strategies to manage the risk of false positives. Simultaneously controlling the FWER and FDP is encompassed by the generalized FWER and the false discovery exceedance joint error rate. Closed testing procedures offer a practical approach to controlling the FDP, and they have been shown to uniformly improve the power of tests while controlling the FWER. Moreover, closed testing procedures are admissible and imply that local tests are also admissible, which can be useful in designing tests with sufficient power. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements can be applied to control the FDP in the presence of random vector adversarial contamination.

3. Nonparametric regression is a powerful tool for analyzing data without assuming a specific functional form. Epsilon-centered error tests and hypothesis tests based on the maximum absolute deviation from a regression function are useful for analyzing functional data. The use of integral methods with a smaller threshold interval can refine the consistency of these tests. Characterizing the variance of the empirical log-likelihood ratio is crucial for nonparametric inference, as it asymptotically behaves like the parametric ratio. Density deconvolution with measurement error is an important application of nonparametric methods, where Fourier transform techniques are used to construct deconvolution methods that cover both vanishing and nonvanishing measurement error characteristics.

4. The study of extremes in statistics is concerned with modeling the joint behavior of random variables in the tails of their distributions. Tail dependence is a key concept that captures the asymmetry in the dependence of variables at extreme values. Causal tail coefficients are a novel approach to reveal causal structures based on tail indices, which are consistent with the causal tail coefficient. The computation of causal tail coefficients is highly efficient, and the algorithm consistently recovers the causal order. Synthetic code and open access packages facilitate the discovery of nonextremal causal relationships. Causal questions are omnipresent in science, and much progress has been made in establishing causal relationships between random variables that are suitable for modeling causal mechanisms.

5. High-dimensional data analysis presents unique challenges, such as the curse of dimensionality. Deep learning neural networks with hidden layers can circumvent this issue through suitable architectural constraints, such as network sparsity. The ReLU activation function in hidden layers allows for the representation of complex functions, and the size of hidden layers can grow rapidly while maintaining efficiency. The approximation capabilities of deep neural networks have been a subject of recent theoretical investigations, with a focus on density deconvolution with measurement error and the construction of deconvolution methods that account for both vanishing and nonvanishing characteristics of measurement error. The practical success of deep learning in high-dimensional data analysis has led to its application in various fields, including image recognition and signal processing.

1. Structural causal models (SCMs) are a subclass of nonparametric structural equation models (SEMs) used for causal modeling. They possess the purpose of acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs, and generalize causal Bayesian networks. SCMs allow for the presence of latent confounders and cycles, making them convenient for modeling causal relationships. Their acyclic property always holds, ensuring that the solution is unique and induces a unique observational interventional counterfactual. Marginalization always exists, and latent projections always satisfy the Markov property, making SCM graphs consistent with causal semantics. The SCM properties hold for solvability and generalizability, with cycles being a special case. Far from being limited to acyclic SCMs, the cyclic preserving property of acyclic SCMs is the aim and foundation of causal modeling theory.

2. In multiple testing, controlling the tail probability of false discoveries is crucial. This involves controlling the proportion of false discoveries, the familywise error rate, the generalized familywise error rate, and the false discovery exceedance joint error rate. Simultaneous control of the false discovery proportion in gene tests, genomic clusters, and neuroimaging is encompassed. Closed tests are uniformly improved, and local tests are admissible, implying that designing sufficient restrict attention to closed tests is of practical usefulness. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements through random vector adversarial contamination and multivariate extension is essential. Trimmed minimal processes produce independent identically distributed vectors, changing the state to become manifest through modification of the marginal dependence structure and impeding surveillance through joint constructs.

3. Control charts are useful for monitoring processes, but obtaining expressions for the overall average run length (ARL) of false alarms can be challenging. Despite the dependence structure of processes, control charts with ARLs of false alarms can run in parallel and be asymptotically independent. This enables uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for ARL of false alarms. Assertions about CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts control charts for detecting abrupt changes, possibly nonstationary, involve identifying regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior. The application is reasonable for detecting gradual changes, but nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error tests and hypothesis tests based on maximum absolute deviation regression are more suitable for precisely detecting smooth, gradual changes.

4. Empirical likelihood and extended semiparametric models have gained popularity due to their practical success in modeling weakly dependent and partially linear single-index regression. Conditional past vectors and parametric conditional variances are added to capture nonlinear effects, with suitable moment equations used to characterize the variance. Empirical log likelihood ratios behave asymptotically, despite their popularity and practical success. Total variation (TV) regularization is surprisingly undertheorized, with minimax denoising of high-dimensional signals remaining elusive. The constrained TV overcomplete frame and white noise regression minimax optimality risk are tools used in mathematical imaging and signal recovery, with TV regularization being excellent in theory. Now, the connection to frame constraints and Besov norm interpolation inequalities is confirmed, explaining the phase transition in minimax risk and the benefits of the BV exchangeable array as a natural tool for modeling dependence in jointly exchangeable arrays suited for dyadic random indexed units, trade flows, and country relationship networks.

5. The recent advancements in nonparametric regression using deep learning neural networks have shown the ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality through suitable network architecture constraints, such as network sparsity. This is exemplified by the least square fully connected neural network with ReLU activation neurons in hidden layers, where the hidden layer size tends to infinity at a suitably fast rate as the size of the neuron in the hidden layer tends to infinity. The proof of approximation concerns deep neural networks with density deconvolution for measurement error deconvolution constructed using Fourier transform techniques. The characteristic measurement error of zero is strongly fulfilled by the methodology, which covers vanishing and nonvanishing characteristic measurement errors. Upper bounds on risk are sufficient when the zero characteristic effect accuracy is necessary, as evidenced by instances where the causal question is omnipresent in scientific research and much progress has been made in establishing causal relationships between random variables through causal mechanisms that manifest themselves in extremes.

Structural causal models (SCM) provide a framework for analyzing causal relationships in a nonparametric manner, using structural equations (SEM) to model causality. These models are particularly useful for causal modeling when the presence of latent confounders is a concern. The acyclic SCM is a subclass that does not allow cycles, which is convenient as it ensures that a unique solution always exists. This property is crucial for inducing observational and interventional counterfactuals and for marginalization. The SCM always satisfies the Markov property for graphs, ensuring that the causal semantics are preserved. The solvability and generalizability of the SCM are properties that hold even in the presence of cycles, although the acyclic SCM is a special case that retains the convenient properties of being acyclic. The aim is to establish a foundation for the theory of causal modeling.

Multiple hypothesis testing requires controlling the tail probability of false discoveries and the proportion of false discoveries simultaneously. This can be achieved by encompassing methods that control the familywise error rate and the generalized familywise error rate. It is important to note that false discovery exceedance and joint error rate control false discovery proportion in gene tests and genomic cluster analyses. Neuroimaging studies also benefit from closed test procedures that can be uniformly improved. Moreover, closed tests are admissible, and local tests are admissible if they are designed with sufficient restrictions. The principle of practical usefulness suggests obtaining informative results through higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements, which is particularly useful in the context of random vector contamination and multivariate extensions.

The process of producing independent and identically distributed vectors can be altered to become manifest in the marginal dependence structure of the coordinates. This modification can impede surveillance, but the joint construction of control charts for each coordinate separately can raise alarms in a timely manner. The difficulty in obtaining an expression for the overall average run length (ARL) of false alarms is mitigated by the asymptotic independence of control run lengths, which are asymptotically exponentially distributed. This enables the use of uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for ARL of false alarms. Despite the dependence structure, process control ARL of false alarms can be effectively managed using control charts, with the CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts control charts being notable examples.

The aim of change detection is to identify abrupt changes, possibly in nonstationary time series, and to identify regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior. This methodology is reasonable for detecting changes that occur gradually and smoothly, as gradual changes are considered nonrelevant. The detection of smooth gradual changes, however, requires precise methodology, such as nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error tests and hypothesis tests based on maximum absolute deviation regression. The functional integral approach is useful for characterizing the variance, and empirical likelihood can be extended to semiparametric models for weakly dependent data, including partially linear single index regression and conditional models that capture nonlinear effects.

The concept of resolution in light microscopy is predominantly described by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF) diameter, which represents the blurring effect. The relationship between FWHM and resolution is manifested by the Abbe-Rayleigh criteria, which dates back to the end of the 19th century. In recent decades, conventional light microscopy has undergone a shift towards nanoscale resolution, necessitating the incorporation of the random nature of light photons. The challenge lies in discerning the ability to distinguish objects, which can be argued to be better described by a random notion of discernability. This is tested by whether an object's total intensity can be measured with Poisson statistics, leading to a linear dependence and a minimax detection boundary related to the FWHM. However, for inhomogeneous processes, the Gaussian dependence is nonlinear, indicating that the physical scale modeling with a homogeneous Gaussian is inadequate.

1. Structural causal models (SCM) are a nonparametric approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) that allows for causal modeling with a purpose. The acyclic SCM and recursive SEM are subclasses of SCM that generalize causal Bayesian networks and allow for the presence of latent confounders. The presence of cycles is a convenient property of acyclic SCM, as it holds that there is always a solution that induces unique observational and interventional counterfactuals. Marginalization always exists and satisfies the Markov property, ensuring that graphs are always consistent with causal semantics. The SCM properties hold for solvability and generalizability, with cyclic SCM being a special case. Acyclic SCM preserves the convenient property and aims to establish a foundation for the theory of causal modeling.

2. The use of multiple tests for controlling tail probability and false discovery proportion is essential in random sampling simultaneously. This encompasses controlling the familywise error rate, generalized familywise error rate, and false discovery exceedance, as well as the joint error rate. Simultaneous control of false discovery proportion in gene tests, genomic cluster, and neuroimaging equivalent is achieved through closed tests, which are uniformly improved. Moreover, closed tests are admissible local tests, implying that designing sufficient closed tests can restrict attention to practical usefulness and obtain informative higher criticism for constructing uniform improvements.

3. The study of random vectors with adversarial contamination and multivariate extension involves trimmed minimal processes that produce independent and identically distributed vectors. The change in state can become manifest through modification of the marginal dependence structure, which can impede surveillance and joint construct control charts. Coordinating separately raised alarms can lead to difficulties in obtaining expressions for the overall average run length (ARL) and false alarm (FA). Despite this dependence structure, process control with ARL and FA in control charts can run in parallel with asymptotic independence, enabling uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for ARL and FA. Assertions about the CUSUM and Shiryaev-Robert control charts can be made to detect abrupt changes, possibly in nonstationary time, by identifying regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior.

4. The resolution of a light microscope is predominantly described by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) spread of the point spread function (PSF) diameter, which is affected by blurring density. The relationship between FWHM and resolution is manifested through the Abbe-Rayleigh criteria, dating back to the end of the 19th century. Over the last decade, conventional light microscopy has undergone a shift towards the nanoscale, increasing resolution and necessitating the incorporation of the random nature of light photons. Instead of describing resolution as a random notion, a test of discernability is proposed, which determines whether an object's total intensity is a linear function of the Poisson measurement, thus establishing a linear dependence and minimax detection boundary for FWHM. This approach challenges the physical scale modeling of homogeneous Gaussian dependence, which is inadequate for implicit reconstruction algorithms.

5. In the context of multivariate extreme value theory, the focus is on modeling the joint tail behavior of random variables, primarily focusing on asymptotic dependence and the probability of observing extreme values simultaneously. Recent research has provided growing evidence of asymptotic independence, which is equally relevant in the real world but less understood theoretically. The methodology revisits the nonparametric rank and parametric approaches simultaneously, asymptotic dependence, and asymptotic independence without requiring prior knowledge of the regime. This approach ensures asymptotic normality under weak regularity conditions and provides a thorough theoretical justification for the bivariate leveraged parametric spatial tail.

1. The structural causal model (SCM) is a nonparametric framework for causal inference, which generalizes the structural equation model (SEM) to allow for cyclic relationships and latent confounders. It maintains the convenient property of acyclic SCMs, ensuring that solutions are always unique and that the model induces a unique observational and interventional counterfactual. The SCM framework also allows for the presence of cycles, which can be conveniently handled by the acyclic SCM property that always holds. This property ensures that solutions are always induced and that unique observational and interventional counterfactuals always exist. Marginalization in SCM always exists and satisfies the Markov property, ensuring that graphs are always consistent with causal semantics.

2. The generalized familywise error rate (gFWER) is a method for controlling the false discovery proportion (FDP) in multiple hypothesis testing. It encompasses the control of the familywise error rate (FWER) and the generalized FWER. The gFWER allows for the control of the FDP, which is the proportion of false discoveries, and the joint error rate, which is the simultaneous control of the FDP and the FWER. This method is particularly useful in gene testing, genomic cluster analysis, and neuroimaging, where the control of false discoveries is crucial.

3. TheCUSUM control chart is a statistical tool used for detecting abrupt changes in a process. It is particularly useful for identifying nonstationary processes and regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior. TheCUSUM chart is designed to detect changes that occur gradually and smoothly, and it is based on the principle of obtaining informative higher criticism. This chart is constructed using the epsilon-centered error test and the maximum absolute deviation regression, and it is suitable for detecting changes in processes that exhibit marginal dependence and coordinate impeding surveillance.

4. The block maxima theory is a fundamental part of the toolbox for modeling extremes. It simplifies the analysis of block maxima by treating them as independent genuine extremes, while respecting the complication of finite block sizes. The theory allows for the analysis of multivariate block maxima and provides a uniform improvement in the asymptotic variance of the multivariate empirical rescaled block maxima. The empirical copula is used to sacrifice asymptotic bia functional central limit theorem, and the block size seems to be a kind of block maxima theory aggregation scheme that leads to substantial improvement in single block length.

5. The adaptive importance sampling algorithm is a policy-based algorithm used for generating particle mixtures. It uses a flexible kernel density and shares generated particles according to a safe density. The algorithm is designed to converge toward the target density with a uniform convergence rate, and it benefits from a subsampling step that reduces computational effort. The adaptive importance sampling algorithm is particularly useful for estimating integrals and for Bayesian inference, where it can be used to estimate posterior distributions.

1. Causal modeling with Structural Causal Models (SCM) involves the use of nonparametric structural equation models and causal Bayesian networks to understand the relationships between variables. These models can handle latent confounders and cyclic dependencies, making them versatile for causal inference. The convenient property of acyclic SCMs ensures that solutions are always unique, and they can induce observational and interventional counterfactuals through marginalization. Latent projections in SCMs always satisfy the Markov property, ensuring consistency in causal semantics. Generalized SCMs can handle cycles, preserving the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. The aim is to establish a solid foundation for the theory of causal modeling with SCMs.
2. Controlling false discoveries in multiple testing scenarios is crucial for statistical analysis. Various methods, such as controlling the tail probability of false discoveries, proportion of false discoveries, familywise error rate, and generalized familywise error rate, can be used. Simultaneous control of false discoveries and familywise error rates is encompassed in methods like closed tests, which are admissible and imply local tests. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements in tests like the random vector contamination test can lead to more robust statistical analysis. Controlling false discoveries is essential in applications like gene testing, genomic cluster analysis, and neuroimaging.
3. Process control charts, like the CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts control charts, are used to detect changes in processes. Despite dependencies in process data, control charts can raise alarms in a timely manner. The asymptotic independence of control run lengths enables straightforward expressions for the average run length to false alarm. However, obtaining expressions for the overall average run length to false alarm can be challenging due to the complex dependence structure in processes. Control charts running in parallel can approximate independence and simplify the expression of the average run length to false alarm, making them valuable tools for process control and quality assurance.
4. Nonparametric regression methods, like epsilon-centered error tests, maximum absolute deviation regression, and functional integral tests, are useful for hypothesis testing and characterizing variance. Empirical likelihood and semiparametric methods can capture nonlinear effects in weakly dependent and partially linear single index regression models. The asymptotic behavior of the empirical likelihood ratio is similar to that of the nonparametric ratio, making these methods asymptotically valid. These methods are particularly useful in applications like remote sensing, computational biology, and financial risk assessment, where capturing nonlinear effects is crucial.
5. Deconvolution methods, like density deconvolution and measurement error deconvolution, are constructed using Fourier transform techniques. These methods are designed to handle measurement errors with zero or non-zero characteristics. The accuracy of the deconvolution depends on the fulfillment of the measurement error characteristics. Deconvolution methods cover a range of error characteristics and provide upper bounds on the risk. These methods are essential for applications like signal recovery, imaging, and density estimation, where accurate estimation of underlying densities or signals is paramount.

1. Structural causal models (SCM) are a nonparametric form of structural equation modeling (SEM) that allow for causal modeling. Their purpose is to model acyclic SCMs, which is a recursive SEM subclass. Generalizing causal Bayesian networks, SCM allows for the presence of latent confounders. It always holds the convenient property of acyclic SCMs, ensuring that the solution is always unique. Observational, interventional, and counterfactual marginalization always exist. Latent projections always satisfy the Markov property, and graphs are always consistent with causal semantics. The properties of SCM hold for solvability and generalizability. Cyclic SCMs are a special case of far SCM. The aim is to preserve the convenient property of acyclic SCMs as the foundation of causal modeling theory.

2. Multiple testing involves controlling the tail probability of false discoveries, the proportion of random tests, and simultaneously encompassing controlling the familywise error rate. Generalized familywise error rates, false discovery exceedance, and joint error rates are also considered. Simultaneous control of false discovery proportion in gene tests, genomic clusters, and neuroimaging is encompassed. Closed tests are uniformly improved, and their admissibility implies designing sufficient restrictions. The practical usefulness of the principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements is emphasized.

3. Random vector contamination is addressed through multivariate extensions and trimmed minimal processes. These processes produce independent and identically distributed vectors, with the state change becoming manifest through modification of the marginal dependence structure. Coordinate impeding surveillance and joint constructs are controlled through charts, with separate control charts raising alarms at different times. The difficulty in obtaining expressions for overall average run length and false alarm arl fa is discussed, with arguments being made despite the dependence structure of process control arl false alarm run lengths.

4. Nonparametric regression and epsilon-centered error tests are used to hypothesize maximum absolute deviation regression. Functional integrals smaller than a threshold interval are used as a subset test hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the maximum deviation is infinity, with the supremum element being appropriately standardized. Empirical likelihood is extended to semiparametric stationary weakly dependent partially linear single index regression, conditional on past vectors. Parametric conditional variances are added to capture nonlinear effects, with suitable moment equations characterizing the variance. Empirical log likelihood ratios behave asymptotically.

5. Density deconvolution and measurement error deconvolution are constructed using Fourier transform techniques. These techniques are characterized by measurement errors close to zero, with strong fulfillment of this methodology. Constructing density deconvolution covers vanishing and nonvanishing measurement error characteristics. Upper bound risks and accuracy are discussed, with the necessity for instances being emphasized. The omnipresence of causal questions in science is highlighted, with much progress being made in modeling causal relationships between random variables. The aim is to connect the field of causal modeling with extreme theory, defining causal tail coefficients to capture asymmetry in extremal dependence between random variables. Causal tail coefficients reveal the causal structure, following linear structural causal models in the presence of latent causes. The tail index is consistent with the causal tail coefficient, and a computationally efficient algorithm is used to consistently recover the causal order in nonextremal causal discovery.

1. The structural causal model (SCM) is a nonparametric approach to structural equation modeling (SEM) that is used for causal modeling purposes. It is an acyclic SCM, which is a subclass of SCM that generalizes causal Bayesian networks and allows for the presence of latent confounders. The acyclic SCM always holds the convenient property that the solution always induces a unique observational intervention, and counterfactual marginalization always exists. The latent projection always satisfies the Markov property, and the graphs are always consistent with the causal semantics of SCM. The solvability properties of the general SCM hold, and the cycle special far SCM is acyclic. The aim is to establish the foundation of theory for causal modeling using SCM.

2. Multiple testing controlling tail probability and false discovery proportion is a method for controlling the familywise error rate and the generalized familywise error rate in random simultaneous testing. It encompasses controlling the joint error rate and false discovery exceedance. This method allows for the simultaneous control of the false discovery proportion in gene testing and genomic cluster analysis in neuroimaging. It is equivalent to the closed test, which is a uniformly improved closed test. The closed test is admissible, and local tests are admissible if they are designed with sufficient restrictions. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements is based on the random vector and adversarial contamination.

3. The trimmed minimal process produces independent and identically distributed vectors, and its change of state becomes manifest through the modification of the marginal dependence structure. This coordinate impeding surveillance joint construct control chart coordinate separately raises the alarm time for the control chart signal. The difficulty in obtaining the expression for the overall average run length of false alarms is argued despite the dependence structure of the process control. The run lengths of the control chart run in parallel and are asymptotically independent, enabling an uncomplicated asymptotic expression for the average run length of false alarms. The assertion of the CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts control chart change aims to detect abrupt changes, possibly in a nonstationary time series.

4. The methodology for detecting piecewise constant behavior in a region is reasonable when the change is gradual and smooth. For gradual changes, the methodology is nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error, and the test hypothesis is based on the maximum absolute deviation regression. The functional integral is smaller than the threshold interval subset test hypothesis. The cap infinity maximum deviation is infinity, and the supremum element is the vertical bar tr vertical bar. The standardization is appropriately standardized, and the cap infinity standardization is based on the Lebesgue extremal center dot refined consistency.

5. The empirical likelihood extended semiparametric stationary weakly dependent partially linear single index regression conditional on the past vector parametric conditional variance added captures the nonlinear effect. The suitable moment equation characterizes the variance, and the empirical log likelihood ratio nonparametric ratio behaves asymptotically. Despite the popularity and practical success of total variation TV regularization, the theoretical foundation of TV regularization is quite limited. The minimax denoising dimensional signal in higher dimensions remains elusive today. The constrained TV overcomplete frame in white noise regression shows minimax optimality risk infinity logarithmic factor dimension overcomplete frame. The tool for mathematical imaging signal recovery is the combination of TV regularization and excellent theory, which is now confirmed to rely on the connection between frame constraint and Besov norm interpolation inequality related to risk functional. Additionally, the phase transition minimax risk BV is explained.

1. Causal modeling using Structural Causal Models (SCM) involves nonparametric structural equations and causal modeling with the aim of understanding purposive acyclic structures. The subclass SCM, known as Generalized Causal Bayesian Networks, allows for the presence of latent confounders and cycles, while still maintaining the convenient property of acyclic SCMs. The solutions induced are always unique, and the observational interventional counterfactuals can be marginalized to always exist. The latent projections always satisfy the Markov property, and the graphs are always consistent with causal semantics. The solvability properties of Generalized SCMs hold, with special considerations for cycles. Far from being limited to acyclic structures, SCM also handles cyclic structures while preserving the convenient properties of acyclic SCMs. The foundation of causal modeling theory relies on multiple tests controlling for tail probability and false discovery proportion, as well as random simultaneous testing that encompasses controlling for familywise error rates and generalized familywise error rates. False discovery exceedance and joint error rates are also controlled to prevent false discoveries.

2. In the realm of gene testing and genomic cluster analysis, as well as neuroimaging studies, closed tests are used to uniformly improve the analysis. These closed tests are admissible and imply the design of sufficient restrict attention tests. The principle of obtaining informative higher criticism and constructing uniform improvements is crucial in these fields. Additionally, random vector contamination and multivariate extensions with trimmed minimal processes are employed to produce independent identically distributed vectors, which change state and become manifest through modifications in the marginal dependence structure. Coordinate impeding surveillance and joint constructs are used in control charts, where the signals for each coordinate raise alarms at different times. The difficulty in obtaining expressions for the overall average run length and false alarm rates is addressed, and arguments are made regarding the dependence structure of process control and false alarm run lengths. Despite this, control charts run in parallel show asymptotic independence in control run lengths, which are asymptotically exponentially distributed, enabling uncomplicated asymptotic expressions for false alarm rates.

3. The detection of abrupt changes in possibly nonstationary time series data is the aim of change detection methods, which identify regions that exhibit piecewise constant behavior. These methods are reasonable for detecting gradual changes that are smooth and nonrelevant. However, for precise detection of gradual changes, nonparametric regression with epsilon-centered error tests and maximum absolute deviation regression are used. Hypothesis testing involves the use of functional integrals with thresholds and subsets, and the limiting behavior of appropriately standardized quantities is considered. The consistency of these methods has been refined and empirically proven. Empirical likelihood and extended semiparametric methods are employed for modeling weakly dependent and partially linear single index regression, where conditional past vectors and parametric conditional variances are used to capture nonlinear effects. Moment equations characterize the variances, and empirical log likelihood ratios behave asymptotically, despite their popularity and practical success.

4. Density deconvolution in the presence of measurement errors is constructed using Fourier transform techniques, where the characteristic measurement error is zero or vanishing. The methodology for constructing density deconvolution covers both vanishing and nonvanishing characteristic measurement errors, with an upper bound on the risk. Accuracy is improved when the characteristic effect is zero, and it is necessary in instances where the effect is nonvanishing. Causal questions are omnipresent in scientific research, and much progress has been made in understanding causal relationships and causal mechanisms that manifest themselves in extreme events. The aim is to connect fields of causal extreme theory, where causal tail coefficients capture the asymmetry of extremal dependence between random variables. These coefficients reveal the causal structure and follow linear structural causal models, even in the presence of latent causal relationships. The tail index is consistent with the causal tail coefficient, and computationally efficient algorithms consistently recover the causal order and structure. Nonextremal causal discovery is facilitated by synthetic code and open access packages.

5. The complexity of learning in high-dimensional simplices, which are uniformly sampled from their interior, has long been a topic of interest in computer science, computational biology, and remote sensing, mostly under the name of spectral unmixing. Theoretically, sufficient complexity ensures reliable learning in high-dimensional simplices, with total variation error elements and epsilon log epsilon yielding substantial improvements in bounds. Box counting dimension is used to describe the intrinsic structure in low dimensions, and it is replaced by the box counting dimension in the ambient space for support vector machine (SVM) regression and classification rates. The learning rate dimension in the ambient space is determined by the box counting dimension support, and the generating regression rate is minimized with a logarithmic factor. For classification rates, the minimax logarithmic factor is within a certain range, while outside this range, the best rate is achieved through training and validation by choosing the appropriate hyperparameters for the SVM. The adaptability of the knowledge generating rate depends on the hyperparameter selection.
