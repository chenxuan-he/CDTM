2. The concept of robust principal components has gained traction in the field of statistics, as it provides a means to analyze data that is less susceptible to the influences of outliers. This is particularly important when dealing with datasets that contain a significant number of异常值.传统的PCA方法在这种情况下可能会失效，导致错误的解释和不可靠的结果。因此，研究人员开始寻找能够考虑鲁棒性的替代方法。One such method focuses on the asymptotic robust principal component, which aims to maintain the normality of the principal components under varying conditions. This approach allows for a more reliable analysis of data, even in the presence of outliers.

3. The pursuit of robustness in PCA is essential for ensuring the statistical significance of the results obtained. The use of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in PCA allows for the identification of directions that maximize variability in the data. However, without considering robustness, these directions may not be reliable, as they can be heavily influenced by outliers. To address this issue, researchers have proposed the use of a robust dispersion function, which aims to maximize the robustness of the principal components while minimizing the impact of outliers.

4. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of robust methods for principal component analysis. One such method is the use of the croux-ruiz gazen influence function, which focuses on the robustness of the principal components. This approach is particularly useful in situations where the data is subject to gross errors or other sources of variability. By maximizing the robustness of the principal components, this method provides a more reliable means of analyzing the data, even in the presence of outliers.

5. The maximization of robust dispersion in PCA is a crucial step in ensuring the reliability of the results obtained. Dispersion is a measure of the spread of the data around the principal components. By maximizing the robustness of this dispersion, it is possible to obtain principal components that are less influenced by outliers and other sources of variability. This can lead to a more accurate representation of the underlying structure of the data, and ultimately, more reliable statistical inferences.
