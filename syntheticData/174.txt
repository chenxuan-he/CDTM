The study of athletic world records delves into the probability theory of extreme events, attempting to predict the ultimate achievable performance in sports such as men's high jump and women's sprinting. By applying nonparametric techniques and weak regularity conditions, the research aims to establish limiting qualities that approximate the likelihood of future record-breaking attempts.

5. The selection of clustering algorithms for classification tasks focuses on identifying noisy and noninformative data points, mitigating multicollinearity and dependencies. The backward algorithm, combined with forward selection, is employed to analyze and validate the performance of these clustering methods, contributing to more robust grouping strategies in data analysis.
