The method accounts for smooth, non-differentiable Bayesian estimation and provides consistent sampling techniques. It offers a calibrated Bayesian credible interval and possesses asymptotically valid frequentist properties. The single-stage unequal probability sampling technique allows for the investigation of the sampling fraction property. Utilizing Bayesian non-informative and informative priors, the selection of complex survey samples becomes more efficient. The application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method ensures required computational posterior vector analysis in surveys. It examines the finite effect of prior sampling and addresses unmeasured confounding threats in causal observational studies. In recent years, the use of negative control mitigations for unmeasured confounding has gained recognition in both laboratory science and epidemiology. This approach primarily focuses on the detection of bias, as Miao and colleagues described. It identifies nonparametrically the average treatment effect (ATE) in observational studies, which are subject to uncontrolled confounding. The nonparametric identification of ATE is weaker when dealing with categorical unmeasured confounding. Semiparametric methods leverage possibly measured confounders to obtain ATE, ensuring robust efficiency. The nonparametric method is extensively applied in post-licensure surveillance of vaccine safety in children. There has been a recent shift towards the detection of high-dimensional sequence changes in various fields like biology and finance.
