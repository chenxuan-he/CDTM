The main theorem of the nonlinear diffusion process bridge diffusion approximation log likelihood algorithm is established, providing a means to approximate the likelihood efficiently. The stochastic kinetic model (SKM) is analyzed, particularly suitable for highly multivariate jump processes in chemical reaction networks, such as biochemical cellular systems. We identify the SKM subprocess as a counting process encoded by a directed cyclic graph, which represents the kinetic independence graph (KIG). This KIG intuitively encodes the local independence structure with a conditional intensity partition and vertice graphical separation. The global independence of the internal history and conditional history of the jump corresponds to the internal history, enabling a mathematical definition of modularization of the SKM. This implies a dynamic graphical decomposition for identification and efficient computation, with a nested modularization application for an advance understanding of biochemical systems like red blood cells.
