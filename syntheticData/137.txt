1. The use of permutation tests in hypothesis testing is crucial for determining the equality of two samples. This nonparametric method ensures that the test size remains finite and does not lead to a loss of power. It is particularly useful in cases where the data exhibits heterogeneity and requires a more nuanced approach than traditional parametric tests. By preserving the exact size and finite nature of the test, permutation testing ensures that the results are valid and reliable. Furthermore, it is adaptable to various types of data, including both parametric and nonparametric datasets.
