In the field of survival analysis, the application of deep neural networks has revolutionized the way we understand and predict survival outcomes. These networks have demonstrated superior coverage in confidence intervals and more accurate survival time predictions compared to traditional methods. Despite the challenges in interpreting their mathematical underpinnings, deep neural networks have become a preferred choice for researchers. They offer a promising alternative to the completely randomized experiment, which often suffers from imbalanced treatment assignment. Rerandomization, a technique that ensures treatment balance, has received significant attention for its easy implementation and improved covariate balance. However, the debate surrounding the optimal balance between randomization and deterministic assignment remains unresolved.

Paragraph 4:
The use of deep neural networks in survival analysis has opened up new avenues for statistical inference. These networks have provided valuable insights into the treatment effect, offering a robust solution to the challenges of unbalanced treatment assignment. By appropriately balancing the treatment, researchers can achieve robust results without sacrificing efficiency. The concept of rerandomization, when properly implemented, ensures that the treatment effect is estimated with high precision, even when the covariates are not perfectly balanced. This approach relies on delicate asymptotic rerandomization theory, allowing for diminishing imbalance thresholds and maintaining robustness.

Paragraph 5:
Deep neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for nonparametric inference in survival analysis. Despite limited research in this area, these networks have shown remarkable accuracy in describing and approximating the sampling distribution of network moments. Their ability to achieve higher-order accuracy, even in the presence of noise, makes them a promising alternative to traditional parametric methods. The development of the network moment ann statist tool has provided valuable insights into the behavior of network moments, leading to more accurate survival predictions. The empirical edgeworth expansion normal approximation has gradually depreciated, as networks become sparser and significantly refine previous theoretical results. This sparsity factor plays a crucial role in the self-smoothing effect, making the network moment analytically tractable and matching the minimum requirements of sparse network theory. The empirical application of the network bootstrap scheme and the selection of subsample sizes further enhance the theoretical guidance in this area.

1. This study demonstrates the empirical success of deep learning in applications where survival analysis is challenging, primarily due to the complex mathematical understanding required. The implementation of a deep neural network has shown to be flexible and capable of overcoming the curse of dimensionality, enhancing interpretability without compromising the effect of treatment on survival. The network achieves minimax rate convergence with a polylogarithmic factor, and the finite-dimensional treatment effect is shown to be root consistent and asymptotically normal. The nonparametric deep neural network offers superior confidence interval coverage and survival time prediction accuracy compared to existing methods, while maintaining a high concordance with the actual survival times. In randomized experiments, rerandomization of the treatment assignment can balance potential confounders, but the balance criterion must be met to avoid unbalanced treatment effects. The appropriately balanced rerandomization approach, although it may sacrifice some efficiency, provides robust treatment effects and maintains robustness, achieving the desired optimality. The delicate asymptotic rerandomization theory guides the diminishing imbalance threshold, ensuring precision without compromising perfect covariate balance.
